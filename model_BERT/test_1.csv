24065,24/065,Kiwibank Limited,Kiwibank Limited  Digital Marketing,08/04/2024,24068,I believe the Kiwibank video ad posted to their Facebook page (dated 18th March 2024) breaches advertising standards. This also airs during the ad breaks on the TV3 on demand. app It is of a young girl| who I could only assume to be around the age of 10| trying to sell her cupcakes in a stall outside her home however none of her customers have cash on them to pay therefore she provides Apple Pay as a form of payment which then mean people are able to pay through their phone or watch. All of this I have absolutely no problem with. What I do have a problem with is one of the characters in the skit - a man in very small and revealing togs. I would like to draw your attention to the Tip Top ad which aired in 2006 called ’TOGS TOGS| UNDIES’. In a light -hearted and comedic way it illustrated when togs become undies. It states that if you can’t see the water| you’re in underpants.  Clear and simple. I know many people my age would be able to recall this ad and instantly be able to call someone out if they were seen to be wearing their togs in a public setting that wasn’t the beach or swimming pool. In the Kiwibank ad| the man in question is standing in what appears to be a quiet neighbourhood wearing an open Hawaiian style shirt and very small  and tight swimming trunks - no water in sight. His female friend (who is wearing a one piece swimming costume and is covering her lower half with a sarong) starts by saying “We don’t have any pants” the camera then flicks to him and he reinforces it buy saying “Yeah| no pants” while at the same time removing the blow up swimming ring that was covering his lower half revealing his swimming trunks. If a man did this in public to a child| it would be deemed sexual harassment. I believe this breaches advertising standards under PRINCIPLE 1: SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Rule 1 (c) Decency and Offensiveness and under the Children and Young People’s Advertising Code as moral harm. I am not prudish or trying to be a ’Karen’| I’m simply standing up as a 30 year old mother who wants to protect my child’s innocence.,"2,3,4,5",2068,,,,,0

This letter is to formally complain under the Alcohol Advertising and |Promotion Code about an  alcohol advertisement featuring the use of dangerous equipment |and watersports which would  be unsafe when combined with alcohol consumption.  |2.

A can of Whiteclaw is on top of the |roof rack and two boxes of Whiteclaw and an open chilly bin are on the open tailgate of the |vehicle.The kite surfer launches from the roof of the ute before coming back to collect a can |of Whiteclaw  in midflight.

24101,24/101,Forest & Bird,Forest & Bird Digital Marketing,11/06/2024,24101,To whom it may concern| I am writing on behalf of the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association  (NZDA) regarding a matter of concern related to statements made by Forest and Bird NZ  concerning their status as "New Zealand’s leading independent conservation orga nisation."     It has come to our attention that Forest and Bird NZ has repeatedly made claims regarding  their position as the foremost entity in independent conservation efforts in New Zealand. As  an organization deeply committed to the preservation of our natural envir onment| we believe  it is essential to ensure accuracy and accountability in such assertions. The NZDA respectfully  requests that Forest and Bird NZ provide evidence to substantiate this claim| as it pertains to  their contributions to conservation efforts o n the ground.     Specifically| we seek clarification on the basis for their assertion| considering the following  criteria:     1. Direct Financial Contributions:   We inquire whether Forest and Bird NZ leads in terms of direct monetary contributions to  conservation programs actively engaged in on -the-ground conservation work.     2. Membership Engagement: We seek clarification on whether Forest and Bird NZ boasts the  largest membership base actively involved in conducting conservation activities| such as  trapline laying| predator eradication| and other practical conservation effort s.     3. Volunteer Hours: We request information on the total volunteer hours dedicated to  conservation work by Forest and Bird NZ members| including activities such as predator  control| habitat restoration| and species management.     4. The NZDA emphasizes that conservation efforts| as defined by the Cambridge dictionary|  encompass practical actions aimed at protecting and preserving natural ecosystems and  wildlife from the adverse impacts of human activity. Therefore| activities such as fundraising  and advocacy| while valuable| may not suffice to support claims of leadership in conservation  without substantial evidence of direct on -the-ground contributions. In contrast| the NZDA takes  pride in its extensive membership base of approxima tely 12|000 individuals spread across 48  branches nationwide| actively engaged in conservation activities through recreational hunting|  trapline maintenance| hut upkeep| and collaborative efforts with conservation agencies such  as the Department of Conserv ation and other relevant groups.    24/101  2 Furthermore| our members' dedication to conservation is underscored by the recognition  received from conservation authorities| such as the Department of Conservation's provision  of discounted hut passes exclusively available to groups demonstrating signifi cant  conservation contributions| a privilege not extended to Forest and Bird NZ. As we compile  comprehensive data on our members' volunteer hours| hunting activities| and financial  contributions to conservation initiatives| we anticipate demonstrating that  the NZDA's  collective efforts align closely with the criteria outlined for leadership in independent  conservation endeavors.     Given that recreational hunters routinely spend hours on species management multiple times  per year| we expect that our conservation hours will far surpass those of Forest and Bird's|  before taking into account the dedicated conservation initiatives hosted  by our regional  branches.     In conclusion| the NZDA seeks clarity and transparency regarding Forest and Bird NZ's claims  of leadership in conservation| and that they immediately cease making this claim in support of  their fundraising activities.     We firmly believe that the NZDA not only excels as New Zealand’s foremost independent  hunting organization| but also emerges as a leading force in conservation efforts| as evidenced  by our rigorous adherence to practical conservation activities. We appreci ate your prompt  attention to this matter and look forward to receiving the necessary information to address our  concerns.,"1,5",4000,24058,This complaint concerned two advertisements. The first was the Forest & Bird website and  the second was a Forest & Bird Instagram advertisement.   The website advertisement included the text “Forest & Bird is New Zealand’s leading  independent conservation organisation”.

I will never get my name on my birth certificate due to the 1955 Adoption Act. This story is not fictitious. It's happening to over 100|000 of your Kiwi friends and family| and making light of it is horrific. If you boil this down| it's human trafficking - taking a baby from a family and then giving it as a clean legal slate as another. This Is a brought -over site from your legal team and something not to be played with It's not lighthearted to be told as an adult that you have been lied to your whole life| and those are not your parents| and it is not fun to travel the world to find your roots. Did you know adoption falls under property law? As this ad appears to feature a young Māori or Pacific man who was adopted by non -Māori adoptive parents in a closed adoption with no knowledge of his adoption and therefore no knowledge of his whakapapa| I'm going to email them from the POV of a transracial adoptee and mention the fact that the govt is currently being challenged by the Waitangi Tribunal and others regarding the repeal of Section 7AA of the OT Act (which ensures that "the policies| practices| and services of (OT) have regard to mana tamaiti (tamariki) and the whakapapa of Māori children and young persons and the whanaungatanga  responsibilities of their whānau| hapū| and iwi").

24129,24/129,One NZ,"One NZ, Cinema , Billboards",08/07/2024,24128,Breach of Principle 1 – Social Responsibility: • advertisements must not exploit| degrade| denigrate| demean or objectify any person or group of people or any products| services| objects or places. • advertisements must not feature stereotypical roles or characteristics which| through their content and context| are likely to be harmful or offensive to people| particularly children and young people • humorous| satirical treatment of people and groups of people are natural and accepted features of societal relationships and may be acceptable| provided they are not likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence This large -scale advertising campaign centres on the main character| a young man of unknown whakapapa who is raised by adoptive parents| who is depicted embarking on a journey to find the truth of his unknown biological origins. He begins his search with nothing more than a tartan -wrapped stone which links his arrival as a brown baby into the home of a white family. - It is a fictional story| however it is of adoption and lost whakapapa that is common and personally recognizable as a serious and sensitive topic for thousands of New Zealanders. - This advertisement exploits of this sensitive topic of adoption to convey a message of “connectedness”| The advertiser has attempted a humorous tone| however the insensitivity shown by this advertisement causes harm to both the children and parents separated at birth| and to other individuals without knowledge of their whakapapa (e.g. sperm donation). - Adoption and separation from family of origin| resulting in loss of identity and whakapapa| is a potentially traumatic event with far reaching social and mental health implications for individuals involved. - This large -scale multimedia advertising campaign is unavoidable – in addition to the broadcast and online video content| it is shown in cinemas| and large billboards are used on motorways| shopping centres| airports etc. - To say that the advertiser should have handled the topic of adoption more sensitively overlooks the fact that a large -scale campaign focusing this sensitive topic should never have been considered in the first place. Specific examples of the breach of Principle of Social Responsibility - The advertisement insensitively and offensively minimizes the trauma of adoption| and normalizes harmful adoption practices| particularly in relation vulnerable young people discovering their loss of whakapapa. The revelation by the main character’s adoptive parents that he is not “biologically speaking| the fruit of their loins” is depicted as a casual conversation while sitting in a spa pool. This is an attempt at a humorous depiction of what is highly impactful moment in a child’s life| and the insensitive depiction will be causing harm to individuals who have experienced similar situations. This depiction also normalizes the harmful concept that it is acceptable to erase or withhold biological identity. It also harmfully reinforces the unreasonable expectations held by society that the adopted child should be universally grateful for being adopted| and that the child should accept 23/129 2 without complaint that their whakapapa has been erased at birth. This advertisement also seems to depict the main character (brown) being thankful that he is in fact not biologically related to his embarrassing (white) parents. This is a stereotypical trope commonly portrayed| the result of which is to minimize the actual harm caused to adopted children – “yes you’re adopted but your parents are kind of awful and embarrassing| be grateful you’re not actually related!” This advertisement harmfully normalizes a situation that has seen a child separated from his biological parents at birth without a thorough legal process ensuring the care and protection of the child. The main character is depicted searching for his whakapapa| with nothing other than a “stone” that was “with me when they got me” and a highland cow for support. This story is depicted in a present day timeline| and depicts complete ignorance of his adoptive parents and a seeming lack of any involvement of the Crown in a formal process that lead to him being raised with his “adoptive” parents. This is a fantasy and a harmful depiction which minimizes the rights of a child to knowledge of their whakapapa| and the availability of agencies and support that exist in New Zealand to support young people embarking on their own personal search for identity. The depiction of a birth mother’s reaction to being found by a child separated at birth is insensitive and offensive. The birth mother is depicted being approached for the first time by her biological child. For most adopted individuals| if this moment of connection is eventually made| the first reunion is an extraordinarily private and potentially traumatic moment in an adopted individual’s life. Yet in this advertisement| it is depicted with humour| and grossly lacks sensitivity and appropriateness. The birth mother is depicted seemingly hiding in a hermit - like existence in the Scottish Highlands before being “found” by the child she was separated from at birth. It might be expected that a birth -mother first “being found” by a child in this circumstance may have recalled memories of far greater and likely negative impact. For example| the shock of an unplanned pregnancy; the dilemma of an unwanted pregnancy; the decision not to terminate the pregnancy; the impact of the 9 month pregnancy; the eventual outcome where she is separated from the child| which likely resulted in significant trauma and grief. Instead the advertisement minimises the trauma on birth parents and depicts that birth -mother reacting with a sheepish smile and remembering an enthusiastic sexual encounter and a screaming baby – a flooding recollection of 20 years of grief and loss which would be a far more accurate but less heartwarming for the purposes of this advertisement. There is one tenuous moment linking One NZ as a telecommunication company (the advertiser) with the main character’s search for their whakapapa. It is when a One NZ employee uses a mobile phone app to match a unique tartan pattern with a specific location in Scotland. One NZ are a telecommunication company| not a social agency. Perhaps One NZ should have depicted the main character making formal enquiries with Oranga Tamariki on his One NZ mobile phone| so that he can be privately supported through an official and structured search for his whakapapa. In the interests of all adopted New Zealanders| One NZ should cease this advertising campaign immediately,"2,3,4,5",6630,,,,,0
24130,24/130,2degrees Mobile,2degrees Mobile  Live Television,22/07/2024,24129,Advertisement features a man with a blindfolded woman in a life -raft in the middle of the lake. The actions and facial expressions of the woman are such that she conveys a feeling of discomfort and tension as she does not know she is on a lake| she does not know the man she is in the boat with or what is going to happen. Her answers are concerned with her safety e.g. replying that she would call the ’coastguard’ when he asks who she would call and that she "can’t swim’. She also wears office casual clothes| further adding to the impressions that she is not familiar with the context. The man portrays the demeanour of being unconcerned about her or their position| saying in response to her claim of not being able to swim| that ’neither can I". She is then told to ’start bailing’ as quite obviously the boat is sinking - still with her mask on. This ad is genuinely disturbing in the current context of attention being drawn to the number of women who meet harm at the hands of men. This is not a long bow to draw - the woman in the boat is clearly not in control| she does not know why she is there and her safety (even though she is in a life jacket) and indeed the entire situation is entirely within the control of the man. Her level of discomfort and the situation she is in is entirely disproportionate to the reason for her being there which is to test if she can ’see’ the difference between the two networks and I suspect that this is meant to be the nature of the alleged ’humour’. However| this is entirely tone -deaf| and would be the case with any gender in the boat under those circumstances but particularly and significantly so since it is a woman. I felt genuine discomfort and distress watching this ad| not only because of the content| but because its very creation and the number of hands and eyes this would have passed through and been approved by| equally reflect the issue that I am disturbed by in the finished product. I don’t think this is humorous but another ’soft’ example that normalises these disproportionate power relationships that in reality lead to the harm of women| in this case under the guise of humour. I am even reluctant to write this for that very reason| but have had a lifetime of this response to my and other women’s very real experience of discomfort and fear with what are often routine interactions with men. This is not an overreaction but an attempt to call out the very actions that sustain the issue at its very foundation. I am flabbergasted and disheartened at seeing this ad.,"1,2,5",2543,,,,,0

24138,24/138,Informed Investor,"Informed Investor , Instagram,",25/07/2024,24136,I am writing to file a complaint against Informed Investor| who appear to be a  financial advice magazine service with a paid subscription model in New Zealand.     Specifically| I am raising concern around a misleading Instagram advertisement which  Informed Investor has paid to have boosted as sponsored content. This post was posted on  3 July 2024| and it’s entitled “Investment 101: What is compound interest?”.     Having read their post several times over| and having shared it with friends for discussion| I  am convinced that there are serious errors in the facts and financial literacy education that  Informed Investor is presenting to the New Zealand public about compound interest in this 3  July 2024 advertisement.     For example| the post states “You earn $5 in the first year| giving you $1|005. But then you  earn 5% not only on your original $1|000| but also on the interest you earn. After five years|  you have roughly $12|760”. This is incorrect mathematics| and this information is misleading  for members of the New Zealand public with limited financial literacy who might expect that  $1|000 could become $12|760 after five years in a 5% simple interest account through  compounding interest as a result of this advertisement.     The post also cites| on another photographic slide| that 5% of $10|000 is $50. I am filing this  complaint as I am generally concerned that a financial literacy and advice provider with a  paid subscription model in New Zealand is posting a self -sponsored advertisement publicly|  with what appears to demonstrate zero effort made around proofreading or ensuring basic  facts are correct before presenting that paid advertisement as financial advice to the New  Zealand public.     I am concerned about the legitimacy of Informed Investor as a service. I am mindful that their  contact information and organisational background information is barely available on their  website. For the protection of vulnerable individuals with poor financial literacy| I would like  this advertisement containing misinformation to be removed and I would like Informed  Investor to be more transparent publicly with ways in which they can be contacted as an  organisation.,"1,2,5",2215,,,,,0

The ad implies that the woman is carrying out a  repulsive job and the nature of the ad is projected as comical. I find this ad totally  irresponsible and very offensive and demeaning to men who suffer from male pattern  baldness which is often associated with excessive body hair| a completely genetic related  condition where they have no choice. A lot of men with this condition have undergone  serious mental health issues including low self esteem and depression which can lead to  suicide.   If the target of amusement was an older women with excessive body hair receiving a wax job  and the people carrying out the work felt repulsed| the ad would not last two seconds.   It’s not ’OK’ to profit from making fun of anyone’s physical condition where they have no  choice in the matter. It seems men in particular are the target of body ridicule in a lot of  advertisements so there’s also a double standard at work here.   We would like to have this advertisement removed for the above reasons.,"2,5",1193,24074,The Frank Energy television advertisement  shows bald men in a laboratory  setting hav ing the hair on their backs shaved by a women wearing a hazmat suit  in order to  compare whether cheaper power is as effective as expensive power.

The complaint is  more about the persons are portrayed as 'gross' for having large volumes of chest and back  hair| and that it's a social normal to be body shaming people who have large volumes of  body hair| and that others should also find it gross. I accept that the advert is in good humor  however some people are quite sensitive to things that are outside of their control.

As a retired people ourselves my wife and Iwe find this ad denigrating towards retired people implying that older people act in a criminal manor by trying to avoid paying their bills while it also appears to send a message that perhaps older people can not afford to go out for fine dining which also very insulting . Due diligence should have been done before any ads of this type are produced by way of asking hospitality industry the demographics of whom of their clientele are more likely to try and skip paying a bill instead of just singling out retired people .

X - “We use a filter to create a separation from the red and green cones so there’s better  color discrimination for those who have an excessive red and green cone overlap (aka  protan/deutan color blindness). It’s not magic| it’s #science”.
