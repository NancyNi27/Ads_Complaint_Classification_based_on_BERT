24006,The image in this advertisement shows people operating advanced cinema style |cameras| and they are advertising for the Diploma in Film and Content Creation course. I |have done this course and we did not touch equipment anywhere near as advanced as what |is shown in this image. The cameras we were loaned were old entry level Canon 200Ds and |the most advance being a single Panasonic GH5. The image in the advertisement shows an |Alexa which is nowhere near what we were introduced to. Potential students will think they |will learn on advanced camera equipment but the reality is very different. They are probably |showing equipment from a different higher level course.,3
24007,This advert shows a man picking his nose. Completely inappropriate and disgusting! I don’t want to see that and especially around dinner time!!,5

24011,"The advertisement is for the Mitsufishi Burger and the catch phase is ""with you for a good time not a long time""...There are a couple of issues with this:1) Cultural appropriation 2) The catch phase is clearly a derogatory sexual reference to Asian females that has been frequently used in western movies and has racial undertones. I believe this advertising campaign needs to be altered and an apology issued. Ruling",1
24012,Advertising flights to Norfolk Island from $199 but when you try to book $880 is |the cheapest available. This was a Facebook ad| not even advertised on their own page| |feels like just trying to lure people to their page and wasting our time.,5

24016,"I found the terminology referring to recent necessary and medically recommended vaccine mandates| social distancing| and isolation as ""discrimination"" and ""segregation"" needlessly antagonistic and conspiratorially minded| and has no place in business advertising| as it has nothing to do with the services offered. It only serves to incite charged discourse and useless| unfounded speculation on political and medical affairs wholly unrelated to the business and services offered. I found the advert to be distressing| and anxiety inducing| especially in a time that the nation is attempting to heal| and get past disagreements as to best medical practice in global pandemics.",5
24017,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement condoned driving in an irresponsible manner and a disregard for the impact on nature and the environment.,5
24018,This ad states that the child dropped a puppy  and that the father was upset that the vet bill was $8000 because he had not taken out pet insurance. This ad is upsetting because of the dropped puppy which indicates that the child has not been taught correct animal handling and care. The ad suggests it’s okay to abuse animals as long as you have pet insurance. This advert is  totally uncaring| unacceptable and upsetting and should be pulled off air.,4
24019,We were watching the chase with our family when a very inappropriate ad came on for fire and emergency with swearing multiple times (yes it was beeped out) but very obvious what was implied. Very shocked to see this on TV.  It was an ad so people dontdrink and cook.,1

24022,Facebook ad including video linked above for nutrient supplement using a |registered nurse to suggest it is has a direct health benefit for crohns and unnamed cancer. |Registered health professionals are not allowed to endorse nutritional supplements so the |consumers profession should not be mentioned. It obviously is deliberately because |suggestions she is a nurse lend weight to her claims of benefits,5
24023,The Complaints Board uph eld a complaint about  the website advertisement for Fat Burning |Ninjas  health and fitness  program . The Board said the advertisement was misleading  because |it made claims which had not been adequately substantiated.,1
24024,The facebook screenshot ad mentions exclusions| but does not mention that |value and extra value ranges are excluded. When in the ordering part of the website| only |then is it mentioned that it applies to certain ranges of Pizza.  |I feel i was tricked into going onto their website under the premise of 50% off. then told the |full details after i was there| they knew what they were doing as once on the menu it was |specifically clarified with a different ad.,1
24025,The Complainants were concerned the advertisement was misleading because:   It is spreading misinformation about the Treaty . It is a translation of an article which was written in Māori in 1922 and translated into English in 1963 . Readers  will th ink they are reading what Sir Apirana Ngata wrote.   The article concerns the English version of the Treaty| and was in line with the thinking  of the 1920’s . The translation contains mistakes.  It is propaganda disguised as independent political research  .,1
24026,Frank energy advert shows two older female adults on exercise equipment that is making their loose skin wobble and make noises to show there is no difference between their service and other electricity providers. This is ageist content that discriminates against and mocks aging.,5
24027,The Paknsave add showers of an electric oven n the water. My 8yr old said isnt that dangerous putting something electric in water. Yes!!! If an 8yr old is picking this up and the dangers of electric appliances in water!! This obviously has had no thought put into the process of advertising.,5
24028,I’d like to make mention that the recent Pac n Save ad on mainly TV3 is not tasteful. Having a BBQ and a Oven in a spa with a person isn’t ideal. Yes| I am aware its only advertising.  But the  way the world is at the moment  someone could do this with a senseless act.,5
24029,"The advert reads in part as ""Upgrading your homes electrical switchboard in |New Zealand ensures compliance with the latest safety standards and reduces the risk of |electrical fires and shocks."" The advert uses ignorance and fear to sell a service that is not |generally required.  |1. An old electrical switchboard does not have to be upgraded since electrical safety |legislation is not retrospective.  |2. An electrical switchboard does not need replacement in order to reduce the risk of fires. |Simply tightening connections on older switchboards would generally be sufficient to prevent |a fire. Also| a poorly installed new switchboard can be at greater rise of catching fire than an |older maintained switchboard. There has ben a number of cases of poor installations.  |See https://www.worksafe.govt.nz/about -us/news -and-media/switchboard -installation/ for |example.  |3. There is a possible higher risk of electrical shock from an older switchboard but the claim |made may not be based on credible evidence.",3
24030,The ad relates to a golf open (tournament) in New Zealand and at one point in |the ad| there is a clear double entendre with reference to male genitalia.  I have no doubt this |was deliberate designed to attract attention.  I think this crosses reasonable an d acceptable |bounds of common decency and is therefore obscene.  If this same type of linguistic |construction were used with regard to the female physiological form| then women would |undoubtedly be deeply offended and disgusted - and rightly so.  In an iro nic twist| the ad that |played directly before the offending ad was communicating information about what to do when |you hear something on the radio that should not have been communicated.  Women have |fought for decades against having their dignity and value  reduced to any particular body part.  |The same right and standard should apply to males and I have no doubt that the vast majority |of females would agree.  Thank you.,5

24035,A TVNZ ad promotes its streaming service showing an armed hold up of a bank by masked| armed men. I  think this ad is totally insensitive to victims of the rising violent retail robberies and its affect on the victims of such crimes. It was even more hard hitting when the news covered a segment of the rise and seriousness of such crimes. Surely TVNZ dont need to use violence| seemingly portrayed to be a comical situation as a vehicle to promote themselves given the reality for lots of New Zealanders is a growing| life threatening reality. This ad affects me emotionally watching it so it must be so horrible for those who have had to endure real robberies in their work place.,5

24040,The Complainant  was concerned that scenes in the advertisement showed grooming behaviour between an adult male and a teenage girl.  The Complainant did not consider this content was appropriate for an advertisement and should not be screened on television .,4

24043,The Complaints Board did not uphold 17 complaint s about the television| radio and digital |marketing B urger King advertisement s promoting the Crunchy BBQ Whopper Burger.  This is |because the act of eating the crunchy burger and the loud noises that formed the soundtrack |to the advertisements were not in breach of the Advertising Standards Code.,5
24044,"The Advertiser is making a claim that ""Slumberzone (is the) Best NZ made bed and |mattresses brand"" without any documentation behind the claim.  This company claims that |the Slumberzone bed is ""Most Luxurious in NZ"". They have not provided any link to any |survey or official report that can justify that statement.",5
24045,The FaceBook advertisements discredit Registered Medical Practitioner prescribed |medication on the basis that they don鈥檛 work. One of the adverts goes as far as to tell people |to stop what they are taking in preference of their product.,5
24046,The Complaints Board did not uphold a complaint about  a television advertisement  from |Global Shop Direct  promoting the Fantastic Floating Mop.  The majority of the Complaints |Board said  the advertisement was not likely to mislead consumers and the bonus items |featured in the advertisement added functionality to the product being purchased.,5
24047,This letter is to formally complain under the Advertising Standards Code about an |advertisement  featuring the waka taua Ng 膩tokimatawhaorua in the water during Waitangi day |ceremonies. The  advertisement| pictured below| was observed on the Thirsty Liquor and Black |Bull Instagram  account on 23 February 2024 (via computer) and again on 27 February 2024 (via |mobile device):,3
24048,The milkrun advert where the woman with phone in hand| is talking to the camera about how to use the milkrun service app on her phone in the middle of what looks like a business meeting. A male colleague then asks her with disbelief and concern| if she isfilming an add about the milkrun service in the middle of a meeting?? Her response in a condescending manner| “Its called  multi tasking Steve”! This implies he can’t multitask for starters. In my opinion there’s multitasking and then there’ s just being plain rude. My complaint is that this advert is also promoting that it’s acceptable for people in general to distract and disrupt others with their device usage. It also says| although you are at work and meant to be working it’s ok to hold up your colleagues and disrupt workflow while you attend to your personal affairs on your personal phone. I find this advert intolerable as I work in the health sector and despite signage telling patients not to use phones while being attended to| every day the services within my workplace is interrupted due to patientphone/device usage. Advertising like this is saying although you might be disrupting others with your phone use| it’s ok. And it most certainly is not.,1
24049,Saying 70% off almost anything| on the website only 2 very cheap things are on |70% off. Have seen this ad in multiple other places with the same 70% off everything.,5
24050,The Complaints Board did not uphold a complaint about  a television advertisement for |OneChoice life insurance.  The majority of the Complaints Board said  the verbal and written |messages in the advertisement were sufficiently clear and consumers were unlikely to be |confused or misled.,5
24051,The Complaints Board did not uphold a complaint about  a television advertisement for Tower |Insurance . The Board said the Advertiser had provided adequate substantiation to support the |claim made in the advertisement and consumers were unlikely to be misled .,5
24052,Date and time 12/3/24; around 11 pm on tvnz on demand. Programme watched was Outrageous Fortune. The advert was for One nz (Vodafone) and showed a person trapped under a quad bike making a phone call. Given the present push on quad bike safety in nz and the number of deaths which occur from these accidents| I believe this advert to be in very poor taste. I know a few people who have lost loved ones to quad accidents| and also people involved in heavy litigation in regards to people dying under these machines. It can be extremely triggering for people to see this image and I personally believe their message can be portrayed in another way| which isn’t making light of a very serious situation in rural New Zealand at the moment.,1
24053,Whilst watching TVNZ on Demand - Emma a PG series with our 11 and 8 year old daughters at 7.00pm| the programme was paused.  The advertisment during this pause was naked men (you could only see the top half)| all making an organisim face.  The words on the screen were ’Ride with out distraction| order a descrete HIV test kit’. The advert was shocking and disturbing.  Not appropriate to be on any advertising platform.,3
24054,Watching The Chase on demand on Friday March 15th at approximately 5.45pm. The screen changed to this advertisement when I paused the show. I had children in the room and find it appalling that TVNZ would consider these acceptable images to broadcast to unsuspecting viewers| let alone at this hour and during a family friendly program.,4
24055,This advert is similar to the one in the Complaint Number 24/028.,5
24056,Top of the South Media ran a full page advertisement by Gun CIty on the |Anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings in the Nelson Weekly and Waimea |Weekly|. The Whakat奴/Nelson community had previously expressed its concern about this| |and how the timing of previous Gun CIty advertisements with this date had retraumatised |those in the muslim community.. It was given this assurance from Top Of The South Media:,3
24057,The Complainant was concerned that the advertisement could be misleading to say the  Advertiser does not have loyalty cards when a card is needed to use the self -scanning system.,1
24058,I saw this ad and didn’t feel it was appropriate. The product has 0 connection to Maori culture which becomes even more apparent when you click the link and are just presented with a standard product page. I feel it’s just a cheap/offensive stereotypical attempt at appealing to our country. I doubt Maori people would approve of their culture being used to sell a laptop of all things. Companies need at least a warning if they think they can just use anything to create an ad| certainly when it comes to cultural stuff,5
24059,Advertisement which is being shown on demand and also on you tube at https://youtu.be/TA3zGraxCFw?si=Lztq5Z7UiJ_zIVxH clearly shows a Ford Ranger being used by a tradie parked illegally across the footpath. In the advertisement this is not called out or  noted| appearing to further endorse this illegal parking. As this is an ongoing issue with tradies across NZ| it appears that Ford supports this behaviour and is not taking action to try and address this issue.,3
24060,The advert has connotations of flashing adult male. A man opening his bath robe to show he is wearing speedos forcing two little girls ( presumably his daughters ) shying away from the overall vision. I find this truly awful that young girls are still placed in these positions in the media to view a supposed man flashing it had nothing to do with selling pools. https://thepoolhouse.co.nz,4
24061,The attached screenshots details an advertisement from JD Sports New |Zealand. This ad on Facebook comes across deceitful and indicates the product in the photo |is part of a sale deal| only to click the link and the product not be part of any sale at all. I |raised this ad with JD Sports who refused to offer any compensation. I believe this ad does |not follow ASA guidelines regarding Truthful Representation and is incredibly misleading to |consumers| relying on click bait to gain web traffic. Alongside this| JD Sports Customer |service did not provide any follow through for the product| that as shown in the screenshot| |was advertised as part of a sale with 鈥渦p to 50%鈥?off. JD Sports informed me they have |requested the advertisement be removed but again offered no follow through for what they |had legitimately advertised.,3
24062,There were eight complaints about this advertisement. The Complainant s were concerned the  advertisement  was inappropriate for public display because it suggest ed sexual act ivity and  was not suitable for young people .,4
24063,The advert claims that New  Zealand is the first country to see each day. That’s not true. That’s Kiribati. This may not be earth shattering. But it’s a lie. Or ignorance. Nice strap line| but wrong. I have no idea what Brandt do or sell| but accuracy is important. Period,1
24064,Product advertised was only a prop. Its size was not proportionate to anything that can be purchased from the company. The size of the product shown in the advert would clearly contradict any guidelines of what would be part of a healthy diet for children.,4
24065,"New World video ad published while watching TVNZ News in TVNZ app. I saw the ad on March 27th 2024. The ad shows a man grocery shopping at New World and the comment says that he is earning more than just brownie points| and shows the man getting New World loyalty points and scanning his New World bar code. The brownie points comment suggests that grocery shopping is a favour he is doing his partner| and not a part of men’s usual duties. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes that householed chores and women’s duty and when men do them it is somehow special and will earn them extra ""brownie points"". Frankly| it is plain stupid in 2024 and as a woman I have had enough. Thank you.",5
24066,The Complaints Board Upheld  a complaint about  a print advertisement from Reality Check |Radio .  This is because the Advertiser had not provided substantiation to support the likely |consumer takeout that tens of thousands of people had experienced serious health impacts |from the COVID -19 vaccination.,5
24067,"The 1Cover advertisement currently seen on their website and on buses around |Wellington city is inappropriate and offensive. This advertisement features a seemingly |Caucasian man looking sickly at Indonesian cuisine| in this case an octopus with the title |""Bali Belly?"". This is offensive because it is othering non -western food and showing it as |poisonous. This is offensive to those whose normal cuisine includes octopus as it is showing |their traditional foods and dangerous and poison and disgusting. This is a constant problem |that immigrants have to deal with in front of their western counterparts who look at non -|western foods and smells of foods as strange and not for eating. This advertisement further |perpetuates the idea that non -western or non -New Zealand food is not good for us. This is |culturally insensitive and will validate people in thinking other cuisines are bad for them and |will make them sick causing isolation to our non -western citizens.",5
24068,I believe the Kiwibank video ad posted to their Facebook page (dated 18th March 2024) breaches advertising standards. This also airs during the ad breaks on the TV3 on demand. app It is of a young girl| who I could only assume to be around the age of 10| trying to sell her cupcakes in a stall outside her home however none of her customers have cash on them to pay therefore she provides Apple Pay as a form of payment which then mean people are able to pay through their phone or watch. All of this I have absolutely no problem with. What I do have a problem with is one of the characters in the skit - a man in very small and revealing togs. I would like to draw your attention to the Tip Top ad which aired in 2006 called ’TOGS TOGS| UNDIES’. In a light -hearted and comedic way it illustrated when togs become undies. It states that if you can’t see the water| you’re in underpants.  Clear and simple. I know many people my age would be able to recall this ad and instantly be able to call someone out if they were seen to be wearing their togs in a public setting that wasn’t the beach or swimming pool. In the Kiwibank ad| the man in question is standing in what appears to be a quiet neighbourhood wearing an open Hawaiian style shirt and very small  and tight swimming trunks - no water in sight. His female friend (who is wearing a one piece swimming costume and is covering her lower half with a sarong) starts by saying “We don’t have any pants” the camera then flicks to him and he reinforces it buy saying “Yeah| no pants” while at the same time removing the blow up swimming ring that was covering his lower half revealing his swimming trunks. If a man did this in public to a child| it would be deemed sexual harassment. I believe this breaches advertising standards under PRINCIPLE 1: SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Rule 1 (c) Decency and Offensiveness and under the Children and Young People’s Advertising Code as moral harm. I am not prudish or trying to be a ’Karen’| I’m simply standing up as a 30 year old mother who wants to protect my child’s innocence.,4
24069,Promoted content on Linkedin| explains the new contractor process to tender for Sensitive Claims and refers to Sexual Violence support and victims.

24072,1. This letter is to formally complain under the Alcohol Advertising and |Promotion Code about an  alcohol advertisement featuring a minor.  |2. The advertisement features a minor and was observed on 7 April 2024. The |advertisement was  posted on the Instagram account ricardochristie| and is labelled an #ad |for @whiteclawnz.  |3. The advertisement is viewable here.  |4. Guideline 5 of Rule 1(b) of the Alcohol Advertising and Promotion Code| (Targeting Adults  |Content) clearly states:  Minors must not appear in Alcohol Advertising or Promotion.  |5. In the Alcohol Advertising and Promotion Code| Minors means people who are under the |age of  18 years.  |6.

24075,My friends| family and I all find the depiction of a man in a dress to be deeply disturbing and offensive. Why are you allowing them to promote mental illness? This is extremely concerning considering the exposure to children. You are destroying our communities.,4
24076,The Complainant was concerned that the advertisement was misleading to state there was  thousands  of items in the sale when they could not even see 1000 items.,1
24077,The advertisers’ email ( distributed on 17 -4-2024) appears to breach the ASA  guidelines due to its potential promotion of excessive alcohol consumption and irresponsible  messaging.   The advertisement could normalize unhealthy drinking habits and imply that the advertised  product can mitigate the negative effects of hangovers| without sufficient evidence to support  such claims.,2
24078,Shingrex advert | this advert is on day and night | it suggests you catch shingles from other people and shows 50 year olds at a party . When I had shingles poeplectefeered to those adverts and automatically believed you catch it when in fact it ’s a medical condition caused from various other  symptoms not body to body .,1
24079,"I wish to make a formal complaint about this advertisement because I see at|least 3 issues with non compliance.|First: Advertisements must not be disguised as something else.|As obvious from the attachment this opinion piece was disguised as a front page article with|the word advertisement in tiny print| which could be easily overlooked.|Second: Advertisements must not exploit superstitious or vulnerable audiences.|By clearly disguising the advertisement as a newspaper article this is exactly what is|happening here. In particular in the current climate where people are already superstitious|the whole tenure of the advertisement is aimed at undermining our local democracy||accusing the councillors of hiding information and wasting money.|Third: Advertisements must be truthful| balanced and not misleading.|This advertisement contains half truths| false accusations| inaccuracies and pretends to give|information about ""secrets"" but that information is already widely known. The advertisement|is clearly meant as an agitator for the voters (ratepayers versus voters is very unclear||everyone votes and pays toward rates) to mistrust the local council by insinuating lack of|consultation and information.|Four: The identity of the advertiser needs to be obvious|Myself and many others in our region have been protesting against this non existing group|represented by an outsider who does not even have links to our  district. Obviously they do|not want to front up like everyone else has to| even claiming it could be to their disadvantage|when their identity should be revealed. Well they may be right about that| we do need to|know who is trying to undermine our local democracy.|It is disappointing that this group that is nowhere to be found and of which no -one can be a|member can have a representative and now secretary from outside the region which|appears enough to avoid disclosing the identity of the person(s) responsible for this|advertisement. What has been called a witch hunt by Hels Ryan were a large amount of|letters demanding disclosure of the identity and discontent with the mis information and|general tone of the advertisement| all written by identifiable locals.|My request is as follows:|That the Advertising Authority acknowledges that standards have not been met and that the|advertisers have to disclose their real identity.|24/079|2",1

24082,The flick energy advertisement does not highlight it’s ability to provide cheaper electricity to the consumer. I feel it provokes anarchy around the general expense of power and sugests a consumer uprising. The advertisement should stick to what it claims it can do for the consumer and not that the consumer should be outraged at all electricity providers.,5
24083,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading to not qualify what brands  the product has 75% less carbs than.,1
24084,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading  and disagreed with each  of the three statements presented as facts.,1

24088,The Complaints Board did not uphold a complaint about  a Tauranga City Council  newspaper |advertisement encouraging people to stand for the Tauranga City Council . The Board said |when considered in context the advocacy advertisement was not misleading.,1
24089,This advertisement is clearly in brach of Rule 1 (c) Decency and Offensiveness Guidelines that states Advertisements must not contain anything that is indecent| or exploitative| or degrading| or likely to cause harm| or serious or widespread offence| or give rise to hostility| contempt| abuse or ridicule. Given the current genocide in Gaza this advertisement not only spreads disinformation regarding historical facts buts is likely to give rise to hostility contempt and abuse and to case serious and widespread offence| this is completely inappropriate use of advertising. 4 duplicate Complainants shared similar views About Advocacy Advertising Complaints about advocacy advertising are considered differently to complaints about advertising for products and services. In assessing whether an advocacy advertisement complies with the Advertising Standards Code| the freedom of expression provisions under the Bill of Rights Act 1990 must also be considered. Section 14 of the Act says: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression| including the freedom to seek| receive| and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form.” This freedom of expression supports robust debate on current issues in a democracy. Under Rule 2(e) Advocacy advertising of the Advertising Standards Code: • The identity of the advertiser must be clear • Opinion must be clearly distinguishable from factual information| and • Factual information must be able to be substantiated. If the identity and position of the Advertiser is clear| a more liberal interpretation of the Advertising Standards Code is allowed.,1
24090,The new McDonald’s ad presents as racist. The ad in question is the new mcspicy chicken burger. The shows pictures of caucasians sweating and signalling that the burger is hot and the voiceover describing the burger as not suitable for everyone. The third person it shows enjoying the burger is a person of what appears to be Indian decent| eating the burger not sweating or signalling that the burger is spicy at all. The voice over describes the scene| for some there is no issue with spice at all. Or to that effect.,5

24093,AA Insurance uses dog puppy photos where the animal is clearly in distress. If  you look at the facial expression and the placement of the ears and the fact the dog was  standing or sitting still in both photos it tells you that the dog is not enjoying the moment. the  one image in the print advertisement is where the doggy has the half door over his body and  the other photo is the puppy with some tape around his neck. I complained about this one  already because it was commented on on social media and more people like myself found  the image distressing and possibly showing/encouring animal abuse. After my complaint  directly to AA it was removed. I think AA is portraying these animals in a degrading and  ridiculing way to sell their insurance as a method of finding it funny that these dogs are in  some sort of trouble but I doubt that these are real situation it might have been staged earlier  by the pet owners for a social media crew laugh. I also doubt the effectiveness| are people  buyy Insurance because they are worried about mischief or would it be to cover broken  bones or serious illness. I think it’s unnecessary to portray dogs in an uncomfortable  situation to gain attraction for insurance.  I’m also not sure that it is truthful. If this ever was  or is a real situation| if it was it shows irresponsible dog owners and encourage or disregard  safety of the animals. I would really like AA to remove these advertisements and stop using  photos or these sort of photos with animals in a curious situation to sell their pet insurance.  there are so many other things that they can use to attract just as many people to buy their  insurance  just by using a cute puppy photo will attract the right audience| it’s unnecessary to  show the animal in an uncomfortable position. It misses the serious point of why pet owners  would be interested in insurance.,3
24094,1. This letter is to formally complain under the Alcohol Advertising and |Promotion Code about an  alcohol advertisement featuring the use of dangerous equipment |and watersports which would  be unsafe when combined with alcohol consumption.  |2. The advertisement features kitesurfing and Whiteclaw| a recently launched RTD. The  |advertisement was posted on 28 March 2024| on the Instagram account marcjacobskite| and |is labelled #ad and #gifted for @whiteclawnz.   |3. The advertisement is viewable here| and key screenshots are included below:  |4. The advertisement shows a kite surfer on top of a ute. A can of Whiteclaw is on top of the |roof rack and two boxes of Whiteclaw and an open chilly bin are on the open tailgate of the |vehicle.The kite surfer launches from the roof of the ute before coming back to collect a can |of Whiteclaw  in midflight. He does some tricks before being speeding past the camera |holding a can of  Whiteclaw. After performing more complex aerial tricks he touches down on |the tailgate of the  ute where three boxes of Whiteclaw and the chilly bin are ready. In the |next shot he flies over the  roof of the ute and collects another can of Whiteclaw from the roof |rack. He then packs up his kite  and sits down on the tailgate of the ute and drinks a can of |Whiteclaw.   |5. Guideline 1 Rule 1(e) of the Alcohol Advertising and Promotion Code| (Safety) states |alcohol  advertising and promotion must not link alcohol consumption with hazardous or |unsafe practices  or behaviour that is risky| for example| but not limited to:  a. the use of |potentially dangerous machinery| equipment or when driving;  b. swimming and other water |sports which would be unsafe when combined with Alcohol  consumption.  |6. Guideline 2 continues that sporting and other physical activities may be represented in |Alcohol  Advertising and Promotion| providing there is no implication that alcohol will be |consumed before  or during the activity| or after endurance events or injury.   |7. We submit that this advertisement may be in breach of Rule 1(e) (safety) of the Alcohol  |Advertising and Promotion Code.  |8. We submit that this advertisement links alcohol consumption with risky behaviour| use of  |potentially dangerous equipment| and watersports. Repeated featuring of Whiteclaw RTD  |products being grasped from the motor vehicle by the kite surfer while in flight comes  |unnecessarily close to implying that alcohol may be consumed before or during the activity.  | 24/093 |2 9. We draw the attention of the Complaints Board to the fact it was actual product| not just a |brand  impression| that was featuring before the kitesurfing commenced| and that was on |more than one  occasion in the hands of the kite surfer midflight.  |10. While the Whiteclaw was explicitly consumed on the motor vehicle after the kitesurfing |was complete| we consider the advertisement implicitly associates alcohol consumption with |the kinds  of behaviours considered in Rule 1(e) of the Code.  |11. Please advise when the Complaints Boards Chair has determined whether this complaint |is to go before the Complaints Board| and provide a reference number for tracking.,3

24096,A billboard that is politically motivated to cause harm. It is racist as it plays to the|propaganda of the manipulations and fear that M膩ori who have self determination in their|lives and culture and health| is bad thing for the rest of us. It is obviously attendant to the|anti-Three Waters movement which is another fear campaign about M膩ori having a say|about land use and a possible imposition on said settler colonial land rights| as far as the|crown was to read it. It is racist in these ways and still more. The propagated fear is that if|M膩ori were to realise a realignment with the treaty that has seen them disenfranchised in|many ways| of course losing land to colonial settlers with no recompense| that if they were to|have equal power in regulation of air| water and land that large land owners would lose|autonomy on 鈥檛heir鈥?land.

24101,"To whom it may concern| I am writing on behalf of the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association  (NZDA) regarding a matter of concern related to statements made by Forest and Bird NZ  concerning their status as ""New Zealand’s leading independent conservation orga nisation.""     It has come to our attention that Forest and Bird NZ has repeatedly made claims regarding  their position as the foremost entity in independent conservation efforts in New Zealand. As  an organization deeply committed to the preservation of our natural envir onment| we believe  it is essential to ensure accuracy and accountability in such assertions. The NZDA respectfully  requests that Forest and Bird NZ provide evidence to substantiate this claim| as it pertains to  their contributions to conservation efforts o n the ground.     Specifically| we seek clarification on the basis for their assertion| considering the following  criteria:     1. Direct Financial Contributions:   We inquire whether Forest and Bird NZ leads in terms of direct monetary contributions to  conservation programs actively engaged in on -the-ground conservation work.     2. Membership Engagement: We seek clarification on whether Forest and Bird NZ boasts the  largest membership base actively involved in conducting conservation activities| such as  trapline laying| predator eradication| and other practical conservation effort s.     3. Volunteer Hours: We request information on the total volunteer hours dedicated to  conservation work by Forest and Bird NZ members| including activities such as predator  control| habitat restoration| and species management.     4. The NZDA emphasizes that conservation efforts| as defined by the Cambridge dictionary|  encompass practical actions aimed at protecting and preserving natural ecosystems and  wildlife from the adverse impacts of human activity. Therefore| activities such as fundraising  and advocacy| while valuable| may not suffice to support claims of leadership in conservation  without substantial evidence of direct on -the-ground contributions. In contrast| the NZDA takes  pride in its extensive membership base of approxima tely 12|000 individuals spread across 48  branches nationwide| actively engaged in conservation activities through recreational hunting|  trapline maintenance| hut upkeep| and collaborative efforts with conservation agencies such  as the Department of Conserv ation and other relevant groups.    24/101  2 Furthermore| our members' dedication to conservation is underscored by the recognition  received from conservation authorities| such as the Department of Conservation's provision  of discounted hut passes exclusively available to groups demonstrating signifi cant  conservation contributions| a privilege not extended to Forest and Bird NZ. As we compile  comprehensive data on our members' volunteer hours| hunting activities| and financial  contributions to conservation initiatives| we anticipate demonstrating that  the NZDA's  collective efforts align closely with the criteria outlined for leadership in independent  conservation endeavors.     Given that recreational hunters routinely spend hours on species management multiple times  per year| we expect that our conservation hours will far surpass those of Forest and Bird's|  before taking into account the dedicated conservation initiatives hosted  by our regional  branches.     In conclusion| the NZDA seeks clarity and transparency regarding Forest and Bird NZ's claims  of leadership in conservation| and that they immediately cease making this claim in support of  their fundraising activities.     We firmly believe that the NZDA not only excels as New Zealand’s foremost independent  hunting organization| but also emerges as a leading force in conservation efforts| as evidenced  by our rigorous adherence to practical conservation activities. We appreci ate your prompt  attention to this matter and look forward to receiving the necessary information to address our  concerns.",1

24103,1: The content of the Ad was sexually inappropriate| triggering for me and totally inappropriate  for a younger audience to see. In the Ad there was a quick scene of a couple having sex in a car - or that was what was implied by the feet on the car window.

Advertisement for raffle suggests that contributing and winning the raffle will reduce suicide in Aotearoa. The advertisement breaches the following guidelined: Gambling advertisements must not: Promote gambling as a means of relieving or improving a person’s financial| professional or personal difficulties| for example| loneliness or depression. Create a false sense of urgency such that consumers may be misled into thinking they must act quickly in order to participate or win. Portray| condone or encourage peer pressure to gamble.

The Complainants said it  was  inappropriate for the advertisement and One N Z to present the serious and sensitive topic of  adoption and the search for birth parents in a light -hearted way.  Complainants said the  storyline  was triggering and that it belittles those connected with adoption.     Two Complainants also raise d the issue of the advertisement being disrespectful to indigenous  and Māori people in the context of  forced and interracial adoptions.,5

24107,There were 28 complaints about th ese advertisement s. In summary| the Complainant s were  concerned the advertisement s were not socially responsible because:   • They glorif y gambling   • The content of the advertising appeals to children .  • Gambling advertisements shouldn’t be played when  children are watching TV   • It’s triggering for recovering gambling addicts  to see these advertisements   • It’s immoral to push gambling when so many people are suffering from the financial  squeeze    24/108  2 • It is or should be illegal to promote gambling   • The advertisements are on 3 -4 times an hour| which is  overexposure   • The advertisements are promoting antisocial and destructive behaviour,4

The ad gives the impression that Contact Energy is currently a sustainable green energy provider. However| their actual claim is that they merely have a net zero target by 2035| which means nothing. I find this misleading as it makes Contact Energy seem greener than they are in reality.

My 4 year old stopped in front of the tv to see that which was showing in the middle of the day on weekend. She was asking me what are they doing. When it comes to age appropriate program| stick to it| what nonsense are you allowing for kids to see?

24126,"I wish to complain about the ONE ad about Connection - Spoken to the brand manager with the add team| and these are my concerns| We have a large adoption group| and we are gathering our complaints to send to you and them Understand that we are second -class citizens who do not have the same rights as you do. I will never get my name on my birth certificate due to the 1955 Adoption Act. This story is not fictitious. It's happening to over 100|000 of your Kiwi friends and family| and making light of it is horrific. If you boil this down| it's human trafficking - taking a baby from a family and then giving it as a clean legal slate as another. This Is a brought -over site from your legal team and something not to be played with It's not lighthearted to be told as an adult that you have been lied to your whole life| and those are not your parents| and it is not fun to travel the world to find your roots. Did you know adoption falls under property law? As this ad appears to feature a young Māori or Pacific man who was adopted by non -Māori adoptive parents in a closed adoption with no knowledge of his adoption and therefore no knowledge of his whakapapa| I'm going to email them from the POV of a transracial adoptee and mention the fact that the govt is currently being challenged by the Waitangi Tribunal and others regarding the repeal of Section 7AA of the OT Act (which ensures that ""the policies| practices| and services of (OT) have regard to mana tamaiti (tamariki) and the whakapapa of Māori children and young persons and the whanaungatanga  responsibilities of their whānau| hapū| and iwi""). You have no idea how deep this conversation is and how horrific it is for many. Connect with family? Are you kidding me? Most of us try connect and then get rejected again - 4 x more likely to commit suicide or be drug addicted. You are flirting with a not -light-hearted topic and must take it down! Imagine how you would feel if you had no access to your family or birth certificate - and you can't find out who you are. Then| if or when you do| you are still not legally allowed to gain access to medical records - 23/127 2 or lineage - and when you hunt| they may be dead - or you're a product of sexual abuse. Please consider this topic before you go any further I ask you and your add and legal team to sit and watch this apology of adoption in Australia you will see this is not light -hearted Being told in a spa pool by 2 hippies you are not theirs as an adult is epic trauma",4
24127,This add by One -Lets Get Connected is disrespectful to all adoptees in NZ. This add falsely portrays adoption and the trauma it leaves for the adoptees. Adopted New Zealander's have been denied their right to adoption records| medical history| given false birth certificates and the right to know their whanau. Many adoptees have been offended by this advertisement| some to the point of triggering their trauma. Please consider the 100|000 adoptees in this country| and show some respect to our suffering. We are an overlooked mino rity of people that are shown so little respect| please hear our concerns. It is of particular concern that this add has appeared just as we await the final findings of the Royal Commission of Enquiry into State abuse| and yes adoptees are part of this enquiry! There is a big need for education on the disadvantages/trauma of adoption in this country and I sincerely hope the Adverting Standards Authority can play it's part in this education.,3
24128,Breach of Principle 1 – Social Responsibility: • advertisements must not exploit| degrade| denigrate| demean or objectify any person or group of people or any products| services| objects or places. • advertisements must not feature stereotypical roles or characteristics which| through their content and context| are likely to be harmful or offensive to people| particularly children and young people • humorous| satirical treatment of people and groups of people are natural and accepted features of societal relationships and may be acceptable| provided they are not likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence This large -scale advertising campaign centres on the main character| a young man of unknown whakapapa who is raised by adoptive parents| who is depicted embarking on a journey to find the truth of his unknown biological origins. He begins his search with nothing more than a tartan -wrapped stone which links his arrival as a brown baby into the home of a white family. - It is a fictional story| however it is of adoption and lost whakapapa that is common and personally recognizable as a serious and sensitive topic for thousands of New Zealanders. - This advertisement exploits of this sensitive topic of adoption to convey a message of “connectedness”| The advertiser has attempted a humorous tone| however the insensitivity shown by this advertisement causes harm to both the children and parents separated at birth| and to other individuals without knowledge of their whakapapa (e.g. sperm donation). - Adoption and separation from family of origin| resulting in loss of identity and whakapapa| is a potentially traumatic event with far reaching social and mental health implications for individuals involved. - This large -scale multimedia advertising campaign is unavoidable – in addition to the broadcast and online video content| it is shown in cinemas| and large billboards are used on motorways| shopping centres| airports etc. - To say that the advertiser should have handled the topic of adoption more sensitively overlooks the fact that a large -scale campaign focusing this sensitive topic should never have been considered in the first place. Specific examples of the breach of Principle of Social Responsibility - The advertisement insensitively and offensively minimizes the trauma of adoption| and normalizes harmful adoption practices| particularly in relation vulnerable young people discovering their loss of whakapapa. The revelation by the main character’s adoptive parents that he is not “biologically speaking| the fruit of their loins” is depicted as a casual conversation while sitting in a spa pool. This is an attempt at a humorous depiction of what is highly impactful moment in a child’s life| and the insensitive depiction will be causing harm to individuals who have experienced similar situations. This depiction also normalizes the harmful concept that it is acceptable to erase or withhold biological identity. It also harmfully reinforces the unreasonable expectations held by society that the adopted child should be universally grateful for being adopted| and that the child should accept 23/129 2 without complaint that their whakapapa has been erased at birth. This advertisement also seems to depict the main character (brown) being thankful that he is in fact not biologically related to his embarrassing (white) parents. This is a stereotypical trope commonly portrayed| the result of which is to minimize the actual harm caused to adopted children – “yes you’re adopted but your parents are kind of awful and embarrassing| be grateful you’re not actually related!” This advertisement harmfully normalizes a situation that has seen a child separated from his biological parents at birth without a thorough legal process ensuring the care and protection of the child. The main character is depicted searching for his whakapapa| with nothing other than a “stone” that was “with me when they got me” and a highland cow for support. This story is depicted in a present day timeline| and depicts complete ignorance of his adoptive parents and a seeming lack of any involvement of the Crown in a formal process that lead to him being raised with his “adoptive” parents. This is a fantasy and a harmful depiction which minimizes the rights of a child to knowledge of their whakapapa| and the availability of agencies and support that exist in New Zealand to support young people embarking on their own personal search for identity. The depiction of a birth mother’s reaction to being found by a child separated at birth is insensitive and offensive. The birth mother is depicted being approached for the first time by her biological child. For most adopted individuals| if this moment of connection is eventually made| the first reunion is an extraordinarily private and potentially traumatic moment in an adopted individual’s life. Yet in this advertisement| it is depicted with humour| and grossly lacks sensitivity and appropriateness. The birth mother is depicted seemingly hiding in a hermit - like existence in the Scottish Highlands before being “found” by the child she was separated from at birth. It might be expected that a birth -mother first “being found” by a child in this circumstance may have recalled memories of far greater and likely negative impact. For example| the shock of an unplanned pregnancy; the dilemma of an unwanted pregnancy; the decision not to terminate the pregnancy; the impact of the 9 month pregnancy; the eventual outcome where she is separated from the child| which likely resulted in significant trauma and grief. Instead the advertisement minimises the trauma on birth parents and depicts that birth -mother reacting with a sheepish smile and remembering an enthusiastic sexual encounter and a screaming baby – a flooding recollection of 20 years of grief and loss which would be a far more accurate but less heartwarming for the purposes of this advertisement. There is one tenuous moment linking One NZ as a telecommunication company (the advertiser) with the main character’s search for their whakapapa. It is when a One NZ employee uses a mobile phone app to match a unique tartan pattern with a specific location in Scotland. One NZ are a telecommunication company| not a social agency. Perhaps One NZ should have depicted the main character making formal enquiries with Oranga Tamariki on his One NZ mobile phone| so that he can be privately supported through an official and structured search for his whakapapa. In the interests of all adopted New Zealanders| One NZ should cease this advertising campaign immediately,4
24129,"Advertisement features a man with a blindfolded woman in a life -raft in the middle of the lake. The actions and facial expressions of the woman are such that she conveys a feeling of discomfort and tension as she does not know she is on a lake| she does not know the man she is in the boat with or what is going to happen. Her answers are concerned with her safety e.g. replying that she would call the ’coastguard’ when he asks who she would call and that she ""can’t swim’. She also wears office casual clothes| further adding to the impressions that she is not familiar with the context. The man portrays the demeanour of being unconcerned about her or their position| saying in response to her claim of not being able to swim| that ’neither can I"". She is then told to ’start bailing’ as quite obviously the boat is sinking - still with her mask on. This ad is genuinely disturbing in the current context of attention being drawn to the number of women who meet harm at the hands of men. This is not a long bow to draw - the woman in the boat is clearly not in control| she does not know why she is there and her safety (even though she is in a life jacket) and indeed the entire situation is entirely within the control of the man. Her level of discomfort and the situation she is in is entirely disproportionate to the reason for her being there which is to test if she can ’see’ the difference between the two networks and I suspect that this is meant to be the nature of the alleged ’humour’. However| this is entirely tone -deaf| and would be the case with any gender in the boat under those circumstances but particularly and significantly so since it is a woman. I felt genuine discomfort and distress watching this ad| not only because of the content| but because its very creation and the number of hands and eyes this would have passed through and been approved by| equally reflect the issue that I am disturbed by in the finished product. I don’t think this is humorous but another ’soft’ example that normalises these disproportionate power relationships that in reality lead to the harm of women| in this case under the guise of humour. I am even reluctant to write this for that very reason| but have had a lifetime of this response to my and other women’s very real experience of discomfort and fear with what are often routine interactions with men. This is not an overreaction but an attempt to call out the very actions that sustain the issue at its very foundation. I am flabbergasted and disheartened at seeing this ad.",5

24132,The first complaint was jointly submitted by Communities Against Alcohol Harm and Turehou  Māori Wardens ki Otara. The Chair of this group has strong whakapapa connections to Kupe.   The first complainant said the advertising:   • exploits| degrades| denigrates| and demeans the mana of Kupe.   • In doing so| the same is done to the persons| peoples| and places associated with  Kupe| including all his descendants.   • Referred to a comment on RNZ from Dr Karaitiana Taiuru  that “Depicting and using a  famous Māori and Pacifica ancestor such as Kupe for alcohol is highly  offensive .”,2

24136,I am writing to file a complaint against Informed Investor| who appear to be a  financial advice magazine service with a paid subscription model in New Zealand.     Specifically| I am raising concern around a misleading Instagram advertisement which  Informed Investor has paid to have boosted as sponsored content. This post was posted on  3 July 2024| and it’s entitled “Investment 101: What is compound interest?”.     Having read their post several times over| and having shared it with friends for discussion| I  am convinced that there are serious errors in the facts and financial literacy education that  Informed Investor is presenting to the New Zealand public about compound interest in this 3  July 2024 advertisement.     For example| the post states “You earn $5 in the first year| giving you $1|005. But then you  earn 5% not only on your original $1|000| but also on the interest you earn. After five years|  you have roughly $12|760”. This is incorrect mathematics| and this information is misleading  for members of the New Zealand public with limited financial literacy who might expect that  $1|000 could become $12|760 after five years in a 5% simple interest account through  compounding interest as a result of this advertisement.     The post also cites| on another photographic slide| that 5% of $10|000 is $50. I am filing this  complaint as I am generally concerned that a financial literacy and advice provider with a  paid subscription model in New Zealand is posting a self -sponsored advertisement publicly|  with what appears to demonstrate zero effort made around proofreading or ensuring basic  facts are correct before presenting that paid advertisement as financial advice to the New  Zealand public.     I am concerned about the legitimacy of Informed Investor as a service. I am mindful that their  contact information and organisational background information is barely available on their  website. For the protection of vulnerable individuals with poor financial literacy| I would like  this advertisement containing misinformation to be removed and I would like Informed  Investor to be more transparent publicly with ways in which they can be contacted as an  organisation.,1
24137,The Complainant was concerned the social media posts  associated with the White Claw  Launch Activation and Influencer advertising were not prepared and placed with a high  standard of social responsibility.  The Complainant was concerned about whether the  advertisements were  targetin g an adult audience | that they contained  content and  personalities  which could appeal to minors and featur ed people who appear under the age of  25.,4
24138,The advertisement for Frank Energy features a women in full medical  protective clothing shaving the back of a man who is one of a line of similar men with  excessive body hair and often bald. The ad implies that the woman is carrying out a  repulsive job and the nature of the ad is projected as comical. I find this ad totally  irresponsible and very offensive and demeaning to men who suffer from male pattern  baldness which is often associated with excessive body hair| a completely genetic related  condition where they have no choice. A lot of men with this condition have undergone  serious mental health issues including low self esteem and depression which can lead to  suicide.   If the target of amusement was an older women with excessive body hair receiving a wax job  and the people carrying out the work felt repulsed| the ad would not last two seconds.   It’s not ’OK’ to profit from making fun of anyone’s physical condition where they have no  choice in the matter. It seems men in particular are the target of body ridicule in a lot of  advertisements so there’s also a double standard at work here.   We would like to have this advertisement removed for the above reasons.,1
24139,My complaint is specific to the Frank Energy advert specifically that focuses  on the shaving of mature men with a large volume chest and back hair. The complaint is  more about the persons are portrayed as 'gross' for having large volumes of chest and back  hair| and that it's a social normal to be body shaming people who have large volumes of  body hair| and that others should also find it gross. I accept that the advert is in good humor  however some people are quite sensitive to things that are outside of their control. It is on  the same level as fat shaming.,5
24140,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was not promoting healthy eating | by  comparing leftovers for lunch with a pie and an energy drink and saying:  “Be like everyone  else” .,5
24141,AMP are currently running an advert where they show older ( they refer to them as retired) people dining out and when it’s time to pay the bill it shows 2 of these retired people trying to skip paying the bill by climbing out of a window. As a retired people ourselves my wife and Iwe find this ad denigrating towards retired people implying that older people act in a criminal manor by trying to avoid paying their bills while it also appears to send a message that perhaps older people can not afford to go out for fine dining which also very insulting . Due diligence should have been done before any ads of this type are produced by way of asking hospitality industry the demographics of whom of their clientele are more likely to try and skip paying a bill instead of just singling out retired people . I believe tghis ad needs to be withdrawn and a formal public apology be made by AMP,1
24142,blindness | that were the subject of this complaint: Facebook| Instagram| website| YouTube |and X.  |These advertisements included claims about the benefits of these glasses| and are |illustrated by reference to the following examples:,5
24143,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading because it says cross - lease titles are “a problem ” for owners and turning  cross lease  titles into freehold titles will   make you more  money . The Complainant was concerned this message could  cause problems  for people selling houses which are on a cross lease.,1
24144,Was watching Love Island on TVNZ+ at  9:05pm on Wednesday 24th July. An ad/trailer for a horror movie “Longlegs” came on| showing disturbing scenes. My wife had to close her eyes as she could not watch it| and I looked away.  There was a woman slitting her stomach and other content that was far out of context with the television show we were watching.  We were both appalled that such an ad would play during a light -hearted reality TV show. While I understand ads usually match the account age and rating of the show| please reconsider your views on the appropriateness of horror films being advertised during such shows and monitor the extent disturbing scenes .,3
24145,The Summerset advertisement with the ladies in the movie theatre has a racist tone. I have to wonder why the Asian looking lady has to have foam over her face and the other white ladies laugh in amusement. Why does it have to be the Asian lady with foam on her face and not one of the others?,5
24146,I have concerns about Brit promoting afterpay as a way to pay for renovations. I believe this is not suitable for a vulnerable audience where the risks of buy now pay later are not fully outlined. Renovations are huge bills and should not be encouraged to be put on buy now pay later. I think this advert glamorises Afterpay and is not socially responsible. We need to do more to support financial education among vulnerable kiwis and this advert isn’t it.,1
24147,"I believe that the claim in the advertisement is in breach of Rule 2 (b) Truthful presentation. I believe that the claim in the advertisement is misleading because it implies you are going to be provided with a 7 day pass to enter the gym| as a trial. However| you must attend during staffed hours. What the ad does not make clear| is that the gym is only staffed a maximum of 5 days out of the 7 day period. You can see in the attached email I have questioned this| and the answer is clearly stated that it is not a 7 day staffed days consecutive pas| only a 7 day pass to go up to a maximum of 5 days. I believe the ’free trial pass’ should be advertised as so - ""5 day pass"".",3
24148,It looks to me like they are using characters with a strong appeal to children to sell alcohol. I viewed the advertisement on youtube at approx 4.30 in the afternoon,4
24149,There were 672 complaints about the advertisement received from 7 August to 12 August  2024. Due to the volume of complaints and the time required for processing| complaints  were accepted up to 4pm on Monday 12 August 2024. Complaints received after that ti me  were deemed subsequent complaints and those complainants will receive a copy of this  decision. Seventeen of the 672 complaints were incomplete and not accepted. The  remaining 655 complaints were accepted| and the Advertiser and the Publisher were invite d  to provide a response.     The Complainants were concerned the advertisement was misleading| not clearly identified  as an advertisement| offensive| lacking in social responsibility| designed to cause fear and  distress without justification| and likely to give rise to hostility towards Māori.     The following is a summary of some of the specific concerns that were raised by  Complainants:     • The advertisement implies  that a significant proportion of New Zealand’s coastline is  about to be handed over to Māori and| as a result| the public will lose access to  resources| beaches and the coastline .  • The advertisement implies it is a simple process to give areas wāhi tapu status|  whereas it involves expensive and lengthy High Court proceedings .  • The advertisement  implies that iwi are consistently restricting public land access and  are planning to increase this restriction.   • The image of a “BEACH CLOSED” sign suggests recognition of Customary Marine  Titles excludes others from access to beaches (foreshore and seabed) .  • The advertisement omits  to mention relevant information| including the impact of  existing titles with riparian rights/ blue water rights in private ownership| which do  restrict public access .  • The advertisement oversimplifies the complex Customary Marine Titles  application/legal process .  • The advertisement misuses the data sourced from Te Kete Kōrero a Te Takutai  Moana Information Hub .   • The placement on the front page of the paper implies endorsement from The New  Zealand Herald .,4
24150,It is for the one.nz advert regarding stopping scams getting through. I am concerned that some elderly people may miss understand the point of the advert. I think it makes it look like any email they get to say ”pay your bill or get cut off ’ isn’t a scam| as they are saying they are stopping more scams getting through. Therefore they might think none are getting through so it ’s ok to follow the link. I think it ’s misleading. I have seen this advertisement numerous times one channel one throughout day and evening the last few days.,1
24151,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement may cause fear and distress by m aking  misleading assertions regarding customary marine title . They said the advertisement includes   a factual claim which is wrong| because customary marine title is not exclusive ownership ;  and the  changes advocated by the Advertiser will not restore the foreshore and seabed to  public ownership  as they do not deal with riparian and other rights not held by iwi .,1
24152,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was racist and misleading. They said the  advertisement includes  false information about public ownership of the foreshore and seabed  as in 1840 the foreshore and seabed were owned and controlled by hapū  and Rangatira in  Article 2 of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.,1
24153,The Complainant was concerned that it was “absolute mis-information  that 'almost NZ's entire  coast is currently under application before the courts to be awarded to iwi as customary marine  titles'. This advertisement contains no factual explanation of this statement and is inciting  prejudice against a minority group in th is country that have been subjugated and minimalized. ”,4
24154,On Wednesday evening (14th Aug) I noticed a card under the windscreen |wipers of my van. It had this card on it. I am appalled that a racist| harm -spreading group |can offer unsolicited information to me. They are a dangerous group and should not be |allowed to spread misinformation.,5
24155,This company is using a Christian image and a sacred symbol to wrongly |promote their business. This advertisement is offensive to several members of our |educational community and goes against many of our students and staff members鈥?|principles. I respectfully request this ad to be removed to avoid conflicts in our community |and our neighbourhood.,5
24156,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading to use the phrase “Dad’s  got one of 100 chances to win $10|000 ” when that is not the overall  chance of winning.,1
24157,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement:   • Is misleading| in particular the statistic “ one in three  people will get cancer”   • Is aggressive and scaremongering| to persuade people to donate   • Implies t he consumer should probably save every cent towards their impending doom  instead of donating it to others currently suffering.,1
24158,"This advertisement about an alcohol drink| that even if low alcohol| still breaches |the Code of Alcohol Advertising Rule 1 (d) Alcohol effect 1. (ii) as it advertises alcohol in a |way that enhances confidence| popularity and performance with showing young people| and |a motorbike about to drink it. It encourages young people and other people to drink alcohol |in a popular way to relax| and with the amount of alcohol harm in the community| and the |devastating effect that has on people| I would suggest it is removed.  And| it breaks Rule 1 |(e) Safety 1. (i) a where it associates the drinking of alcohol consumption with risky |behaviours such as motorcyling. And| it breaks Rule 2 Truthful Presentation 2 (b) 2. (i)| (ii)| |and (iii) where it enhances mental or physical capability with the motorbike in it. Even if the |drink is of low alcohol consumption| it still encourages and makes it look attractive| popular |and ""cool"" for people to drink| and no alcoholic drink no matter how much alcohol is in it |should show it that way when there is so much harm associated with it| and people need |healthier and safer ways to relax and enjoy life aside from drinking associated with |motorcyling and socializing which is very unsafe. I would highly recommend that in such |difficult economic times for people too that they should not be encouraged to spend money |on alcohol when they need to save and be careful with their spending| and also not develop |addictions which could be difficult to get off with the health services stretched also| and need |to be directed towards safer and healthier aspects of life.",0
24159,There were seven  complaints about this  advertisement. The Complainants were concerned  the advertisement was offensive  and inappropriate | especially in a location  where there are  young families | seniors | a kindergarten  and a primary school . The Complainants also said  the advertisement w as misleading  about the nature of the content being promoted.,0
24160,1. Inappropriate sexual innuendo about male genitalia  |2. Racism. I tired of white males alway being portrayed and weak and stupid (if at all)  |3. The idea of selling a person isn funny. It abhorrent.,0
24161,Location: floor of feminine hygiene and personal products aisle at Bargain |Chemist Whangaparaoa. This is a large (approx 40x40) adhesive floor image that depicts a |pair of discarded women's underwear with the words 鈥渄on鈥檛 get your knickers in a twist over |the itch鈥? This image is easily visible to anyone visiting the store| is unmistakably a pair of |women's underwear| and in my view makes a joke of women's intimate issues by |associating it with the term 鈥済et your knickers in a twist鈥?which is in itself a  term used to |describe the action of becoming upset about something trivial. The image of discarded |underwear is inappropriate in a retail healthcare setting and makes the process of |purchasing feminine hygiene products in that store an embarrassing one. It will be seen by |young and old and anyone wishing to purchase those items finds themselves confronted |with it. The floor sticker has been provided to the store by the supplier of the products |(Kolorex) and is part of an advertising campaign.,0
24162,The add features someone grating a jade plant to put in food. Jade plants are |toxic so add could make people think it is edible,0
24163,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading as Wi -Fi Pro is a specific  Google product and this is not what Orcon is offering.,0
24164,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was misleading because it implie d that  an income protection insurance policy would pay income following an accident. The  Complainant said this is highly unlikely because of the ACC scheme| which can pay up to 80%  of income following an accident.,0
24165,This advertisement was aired twice between 14.00 hrs and 16:00 hrs. on |Sunday 15 Sept 2024. It was offensive because it implied that |aggressive/dismissive/arrogant behaviour from a woman directly towards a man (who is |portrayed as being a subordinate) is acceptable. It is not. Equally the same behaviours |shown by a man towards a woman are not acceptable. Such behaviours by either gender |are not acceptable even if there is no implied superior -subordinate relationship. All this |advert does is to seek to justify to women that they can behave this way in some strange |MeToo fashion. This is deeply offensive and I suspect will be so to those of either gender |who have any moral compass or reasonable code of behaviour. The example that this |advertisement sets demeans all society. This is first time in 60+ years that I have ever |considered complaining about an advertisement. It is truly shocking. Please get it removed |immediately,0
24166,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement showed an exotic North American turtle  being released into a river| which is an environmental problem in the Bay of Plenty.,0
24167,There were 86 complaints about the  advertisement. The Complainants were concerned the  advertisement  was offensive because it feature d adult themes that were inappropriate for an  unrestricted media environment . The Complainants were concerned that  the advertisement  contained cartoon -like imagery that could be appealing to children|  and it was  located in public  spaces where anyone could see it.,0
24168,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was inappropriate and “ lends itself to Nazi  sentiment ” because it used a fake German accent and talked about German superiority .,0
24169,"The content is offensive to Christian belief|  advertising that ""the temple of |Bathhurst"" has a man  performing miracles| waving his hands and changing  events in |an unexplained way. This belittles  historical Christian| biblical Gospels and writings.",0
24170,"I believe Parallel Imported are breaching ’Principle 2 Rule 2 (b) Truthful  presentation’ when they display the number of apparent customers viewing a product page.  On all product pages below the buy now button is a section that suggests| ""X customers are  viewing this product"".",0
24171,There were two complaints about th is advertisement. The Complainants were concerned the  advertisement  was offensive because it feature d adult themes that are inappropriate for  children. The Complainants were concerned that the advertisement contained imagery that  would be appealing to children and primary schools| kindergartens and preschools were all in  close proximity to these posters.,0
24172,There w as one  complaint about th is advertisement. The Complainant w as concerned the  advertisemen t was highly offensive| especially in a  public space where children are  exposed  to them .,0
24173,Partially naked man plugging in electric vehicle. Although nothing is seen as |hidden by vehicle mirror in this advert it is on earlier in the day when children are watching. |They questioned what the ad was actually about and why the man didn鈥檛 have clothing.,0
24174,The Uber Eats Advertisement features snapping animal traps (like gin traps). I |think this is very inappropriate to advertise a food delivery service. Many animals have |suffered horrible deaths in these traps.,0
24175,The complaints all relate to the brand Grog| and their Instagram page Drink |Grog. The attachment shows the five different advertisements:  |1. Win a Grog Fridge 鈥?Appears to advertise a competition contingent on purchase of |alcohol 鈥?Irresponsible Promotion of Alcohol SaSAA 237(1)(e),0
24176,Milkrun has a creative marketing team| but they fail to listen to feedback and it 's |not good enough from a large grocery retailer like Woolworths to be misleading.,0
24177,Four complaints raised the following issues about the billboard.  |?Inappropriate messaging about sex workers and drugs in an unrestricted |environment . |Offensive message about criminal proceedings . |Offensive to family members of the deceased.  |鈥?Conflates sex work (legal) and methamphetamine use (illegal) and this is |stereotypical and harmful . |鈥?Offensive to use a commentary relating to someone's death to promote alcohol |sales . |鈥?Inappropriate message and use of 鈥測eah right鈥?phrase given the trial outcome .,0
24178,Woolworhts are putting an ad on YouTube (I don watch TV so don know if it |there too!) claiming FREE stuff. As part of their advertisement hey show a woman| called |Georgia| opening a fridge. The ad claims FREE MILK. Georgia takes milk| clearly labelled as |belonging to someone else| as FREE - presumably. This is clearly not true - the time is not |FREE| it clearly belongs to Derek and sh is committing theft. No matter how apparently |minor the protoganist in the advertisement is a thief. This ad perpetuates the notion of |鈥檝ictimless鈥?crime if you do not get caught doing it. Derker paid for his Milk| and is clearly |aware someone is stelgin his milk and is trying to mitigate that problem - yet Georgia |continues to steal his milk. The ad is without conscience and is grandising theft.,0
24179,I am concerned with the wording of this advert from the Act party. “Restore”  implies the proposed bill is merely reinstating a previous state. This is false - the bill aims to  reinterpret Te Tiriti. There is no intent to “restore”.,0
24180,The word ‘restore’ equal rights is inflammatory and unsubstantiated. ’restore’   implies that people have less than equal rights. But they do not clarify who allegedly has  more rights and who has less. The ad is designed to inflame and divide and is deeply  offensive. I am a typical ACT voter demographic but I am shocked that they are allowed to  campaign in this way.,0
24181,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement was degrading and demeaning to people  with breasts who don't conform to the gender stereotypes of women in our society.,0
24182,Advertisement depicts men with frustrated expressions on their faces| along |with the tagline 鈥渂et it out.鈥?I find this highly inappropriate as it encourages men to turn to |gambling when faced with negative emotion. Moreover| it makes a joke of  the known mental |health crisis| wherein the public are more susceptible and vulnerable to turn to negative |coping mechanisms (gambling| etc). There needs to be intervention here as the 鈥榰nspoken鈥?|element of this advertisement targets vulnerable communities and normalises gambling.,0
24183,The Complainant was concerned the advertisement made a misleading environmental claim|  that Tyrewise was 'saving the planet' .,0
24184,Air NZ advertises their Airpoints by saying 鈥? Airpoints Dollar 鈩?is the equivalent |to 1 New Zealand Dollar鈥? However| when you go to spend them| you can only spend them |in the Air NZ store and if you try to use them to purchase flights with Air NZ| you can鈥檛 use |them towards the tax or airport fees for the flight| so you can actually only use them for 60 -|70% of the value of the flight. Therefore an Airpoints dollar is not equivalent to a New |Zealand dollar as with a New Zealand dollar you can pay for the full value of a flight but with |an Airpoint dollar you can only pay for 60 -70% of a flight. Air NZ should not be able to make |this claim as it's misleading and incorrect. Also Airpoints can only be spent at the Airpoints |store| so they鈥檙e not as flexible as a New Zealand dollar| so again the claim that they鈥檙e |equivalent is misleading,0
24185,This advertisement is degrading for women| showing financial success as being |like a woman lying down in a flash dress| and encourages disrespect and degrading |treatment towards women| when there is already a high rate of disrespect and mistreatment |towards women in this country. It also implies that a woman can get financial success very |easily by using Afterpay| which in most cases could be quite unrealistic and breaks Rule 2 |(b) Truthful presentation| where the product must not mislead| deceive or confuse |consumers| or abuse their trust or exploit their lack of knowledge| and cannot exaggerate or |make an unrealistic claim or false representation. It also shows a girl lying down as an |example of false financial gain which is not in support of the safety of women| and shows an |unrealistic idea that even guys may gain a women with money through using their product. It |shows to use their product they could get the girl and the money| and degrade her which is |not safe for women. This advertisement also deceives and misleads people with those |assumptions implied| and that it is easy to get that degree of financial success quickly which |is probably quite unrealistic and degrading for women. It also breaks Rule 2 (b) Truthful |presentation| 1. where obvious untruths| and exaggerations cannot be associated with |financial claims and it makes women look ridiculous too associated with financial success of |using Afterpay that is also probably also quite unrealistic. It breaks Rule 2(c) Use of data (iii) |where the level of risk is understated and is not safe| and is not safe for women being |associated with there is risk with guys thinking they may be able to use that product and get |a girl looking flash and disrespected such as in this picture.  I would suggest safer |advertisements of women| to support respectful and safe treatment of them| and more |realistic depictions of the product/s and safer ways of using finances in difficult financial |times.,0
24186,This advertisement advertises alcohol while making it look attractive and |appealing to young people| and others with the people in the advertisement looking |attractive and wearing nice clothes| and having a good time. This encourages young people |especially to drink excessively and in difficult financial times with events such as the |pandemic and climate change| as well as the uncertain economic times| this is not |acceptable| as they need to be saving for their future. And| it breaks the rules of Rule 1 (d) |Alcohol effects: (ii) where alcohol advertising cannot show advertisements that enhance |confidence| popularity| attractiveness| and physical ability. It also breaks (iii) where it shows |it is necessary for enjoyment or an activity. And| it breaks Rule 2 (b) Truthful Presentation |where 2. It cannot show (ii) where it positively changes mood| physical condition or |behaviour. Young people need to be supported and encouraged with safe| responsible |behaviour| and this advertisement encourages unsafe and risky behaviour in difficult times |which is not acceptable. People need positive| safe ways of enjoying life in such challenging |times for people|  especially the young people and next generation. Also| a lot of the young |people in this advertisement are of another  ethnicity and can imply quite racist connotations |which is not acceptable either| and encourages those of other ethnicities to drink a lot| who |suffer from some of the worst of social circumstances| discrimination and need more |respect| and safety too.,0
24187,An advertisement that seems to be referencing the Jeffery Epstein Island seems |extremely inappropriate. is the joke that people DO know people who are pedophilias???,0
24188,Hi I  was flicking through the new Star Newspaper and found out that Star let a |radical misinformed group publish their hate content on steroids.  Stuff refused to print this |becuase the article does not contain any facts. It comes off being very antisemitic| shouting |and irrational reasoning;,0
24189,The Afterpay advertisement has a young person talking about using Afterpay to |fund their move to Australia| including using it for buying appliances and other related |moving costs once the customer gets there. I believe that this advertisement is likely to |cause serious harm to New Zealand. The loss of even one additional young adult to |Australia| especially if we have funded their education| welfare| and upbringing| represents |significant social harm to New Zealand. I therefore believe that the advertisement is |therefore both harmful to New Zealand and offensive under the code. Advertisements must |not contain anything that is indecent| or exploitative| or degrading| or likely to cause harm| or |serious or widespread offence| or give rise to hostility| contempt| abuse or ridicule. I |therefore believe that this advertisement is in breach of the code.,0
24190,Bluebird have partnered with Squid Game. The well known Netflix show is rated |R16 and contains graphic violence including murder| sexual activity and torture.  |Bluebird do not have to display a rating for a TV show but in the interest's of consumer |safety they are remiss to use imagery such as characters and set design to normalize their |product being involved in such levels of gore and horror.  |This show is about real people being killed in real life contests (not literally as it is acting) but |is not a fantasy world like say Lord of the Rings.  |I鈥檓 well aware that children watched this show in 2021 but it has a rating for a reason and |Bluebird's approach should be to protect not condone this kind of violence by association in |front of young minds.  |How can a parent tell a child they mustn鈥檛 watch this show when the chips they take to |school or eat while they watch TV have this Squid Game advert emblazoned across the |packets and appear in their YouTube feed.,0
24191,I wish to submit a complaint for misleading advertising by Delivereasy which is |actively promoted through their website and on social media. I have come across this |sponsored post twice this week on Facebook. Based off the comments this has been up for |several weeks and is misleading because: - Nowhere in the advertisement does it state this |is limited to addresses who have never ordered a Delivereasy order before. This stretches |the definition of new and relies on people having to a) create an account| find a store| order |food| enter their address and then enter NEWBIE before they are told they are not eligible or |b) read the fine print to confirm this is only open to addresses who haven鈥檛 ordered this |before.,0
