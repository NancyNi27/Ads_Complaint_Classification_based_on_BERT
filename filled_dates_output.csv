The |billboard is located directly opposite Kowhai Intermediate School located at 26 Onslow Rd| |occupying the other corner of Onslow and Sandringham Roads. Photographs of the billboard |are appended. |Principle 3 of the Code for Advertising and Promotion of Alcohol states: |Alcohol advertising and promotions shall be directed at adult audiences. Alcohol advertis ing |and promotions shall not be directed at minors nor have strong or evident appeal to minors in |particular. This applies to both content and placement. |Given the placement of the billboard in very close proximity to Kowhai Intermediate School| |we submit that this placement is inconsistent with Principle 3 of the Code for Advertising and |Promotion of Alcohol. The placement of the billboard also raises concerns around social |responsibility. We request that the Complaints Board Chair consider whether the |advertisement should be considered under Principle 1 (with reference to guideline 1g) of the |Code for Advertising and Promotion of Alcohol| Principle 1 (Rule 1i| targeting children) of the |Children and Young People 's Advertising Code| and Principle 1 of the A dvertising Standards |Code. |We submit that placing| and continuing to place| alcohol advertisements in close proximity to |schools is inconsistent with a high standard of social responsibility| and ask that the |Complaints Board consider whether this advertis ement breaches the advertising codes |referred to above.

To me, it is a clear attempt to influence the result of the referendum based on the advertising spots chosen by demographic on swing votes. Based on the political nature o f the advertisement I believe the add should be pulled from broadcast and compensatory broadcast of both sides of the debate. I don’t disagree with the facts stated simply do not believe that the add is transparent and the message is being corrupted to hij ack and potentially politically influence the outcome of the referendum. As the add is political in nature therefore I ask that it be treated to more stringent standards stating more clearly that they are individuals stories and who Unsaid are and their in terests with funding from the NZTA. It is not clear at all and took some digging for me to find out more details. Many people will not bother.

20440,20/440,The Advance N ew Zealand Party,Advance NZ Party and NZ Public,25/09/2020,20345,"We are complaining about a one -page advertisement that ap peared in ‘Waikato News’, a NZ Herald Supplement published on 18 September 2020 (copy attached). It contains the statement “COVID -19 death rate now known to be comparable to seasonal flu” as its central message. It then implies, based on this statement, t hat public health control measures are excessive, notably that the use of physical distancing (lockdowns), masks, testing and case/contact quarantine/isolation are not justified. We consider this irresponsible advertising based on the principles and rules of the Advertising Standards Code (https://www.asa.co.nz/codes/codes/advertising -standards -code/). We are objecting to this advertising on two specific grounds: • Principle 2: truthful presentation: “Advertisements must be truthful, balanced and not misleading”. Specifically - Rule 2 (b) Truthful presentation • Principle 1: social responsibility: “Advertisements must be prepared and placed with a due sense of social responsibility to consumers and to society”. Specifically Rule 1 (e) Safety Rule 2 (b) Truthful presentation: “Advertisements must not mislead or be likely to mislead, deceive or confuse consumers, abuse their trust or exploit their lack of knowledge. This includes by 20/440 8 implication, inaccuracy, ambiguity, exaggeration, unrealistic claim, om ission, false representation or otherwise.” The central statement “COVID -19 death rate now known to be comparable to seasonal flu” is blatantly incorrect and not supported by widely held and published scientific evidence. Using detailed New Zealand and international data we have reported in the British Medical Journal, the death rate from COVID -19 to be around 17 times higher than for seasonal flu in New Zealand. See: MG Baker, N Wilson. Rapid Response: The COVID -19 elimination debate – needs to use corr ect data. (Published 09 September 2020) BMJ 2020; 370 doi: https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3410/rr -6 Rule 1 (e) Safety “Advertisements must not, unless justifiable on educational or soci al grounds, encourage or condone dangerous, illegal or unsafe practices, or portray situations which encourage or condone a disregard for safety”. There is overwhelming evidence that the use of public health measures (notably lockdowns and testing, contac t tracing, isolation and quarantine) was successful in eliminating COVID - 19 from New Zealand for a period of over 3 months, giving New Zealand the lowest mortality rate from this pandemic in the OECD (see: Baker MG, Wilson N, Anglemyer A. Successful elimin ation of covid -19 transmission in New Zealand. New England Journal of Medicine. 2020 Aug 20;383(8):e56. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2025203 ). New Zealand is on track to eli minate this infection again, using these public health measures, which will provide ongoing protection of New Zealanders, particularly those who are most vulnerable (older, living with long -term conditions, Māori and Pacific peoples – as seen in previous p andemics: Wilson et al 2012, Emerging Infectious Diseases https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310086/ ). Encouraging disregard for critical public health measures is highly i rresponsible – especially so when poorly controlled pandemic spread in New Zealand could kill thousands of people. Such behaviour poses a risk to the safety of both the individuals involved in such action (eg, through lack of physical distancing and mask u se), and to the entire New Zealand population (as it threatens the wider goal of pandemic containment and elimination).

21482,21/482,Department of Internal Affairs,Three Waters Television,12/10/2021,21462,"I would like to complain about the Three Waters TV Commercial on T,V and the supporting print advertising. It is propaganda. This is government created propaganda on our screens and should be removed immediately. It is unfactual and very deliberately misleading. It should be called out as misleading propaganda and should be removed immediately. The creators and the o rganisations involved in producing this should be asked to apologise publcily to New Zealanders for attempting to mislead them. This TV ad tells the viewer that the government is working with Councils so that we can all have better drinking water. This is misleading on 4 fronts: 1. The TV ad says the government is working with Councils which implies Councils are supportive. Government is not working with Council. Nor are Councils supportive. The government asked Councils to handover their water assets and the Councils have said no. ‘Asking’ is not ‘working’. This is deliberately misleading. The Mayors of many of the Council around New Zealand have made their view clear - that they have informed the government they don't want to proceed with Three Waters as they have serious issues with it on many fronts, including governance, flawed deal structure, flawed payment structure, flawed ownership structure, very serious to ratepayers water supply, unduly hurried timeframe that means Councils can't consult ratepay ers, non -payment by government until 2024, problematic proposed new ownership that could fail ratepayers. The list is long. 2. The TV ad says it is about better water. This is misleading too. Three Waters is actually about ownership. Shifting ownership o f New Zealand’s water assets into government and Maori ownership. This is actually the goal of the Government’s He Puapua plan, it is not about better water. The government should have stated the truth in the Three Waters advertising. Instead none of this is clarified in the TV ad or the print ad. It is completely misleading to only say that it is about better water. It is like saying smoking is cool without saying the negative health effects. The TV ad is trying to convince New Zealand consumers it is only about water quality, even though much of NZ has water quality. This is about ownership shifts to government and Maori and the TV ad must say that. 3. The TV ad is false and misleading via omission. It is like a cigarette company leaving off health warni ngs. The government and its Advertising Agency have used a friendly and child - like cartoon format like a children’s book. When it says it is working with Councils, it should 21/482 8 say it has asked Councils to give up their rights to ownership of their water supp ly, without payment until 2024, with government and iwi making decisions on how the payment of assets can be used Even the Mayor of Auckland, the city that accounts for half the households in New Zealand has publicly stated that he has no issue with water quality or systems in Auckland and does not support this changed ownership and plan put forward by the government. 4. The advertising agency, government. government ministries involved have created propaganda. I feel strongly that the Advertising Standar ds Authority needs to set out clear guidelines that make it illegal for deliberately misleading propaganda like this to ever come onto our screens again. The definition of propaganda is ""information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to pro mote a political cause or point of view."" The Three Waters TV Ad and Print Advertising ads clearly fall into this category. In this case, the misleading information is being used to promote the Government’s other agenda and cause, He Puapua. They should ha ve said this in the TV advertisement, and not created a cover up. The TV ad should be removed and remade with the truth clearly articulated if it needs to return to our screens. Three Waters should communicate clearly to New Zealanders and ratepayers, the very important, irrevocable changes to their water supply, the assets and the fact that this will affect the future of their water, forever. That: - Three Waters takes away ownership of the freshwater supply and assets from their Council and gives it to th e government - Three Waters irrevocably shifts 100% of ownership of a Council’s water supply to a new entity owned by the government, with 50% of this ownership of water assets and water supply given to Maori who will have governance over future water supp ly - Three Waters takes away the water supply and assets of organisations and regions like Auckland and Watercare, that DO NOT have problems with water. Regions that do not need ‘better water and better water systems’ – this is the opposite of what the TV ad currently says Government and their agencies should NOT produce misleading advertising. This practice should be slammed and come down hard on. New Zealanders deserve better. Just because it is the NZ government and a government department who created th e advertising, they and their agency are not entitled to produce misleading TV commercials. THey should not be allowed to create advertising messages that deliberately mislead New Zealanders. This is a critical issue, it doesn't get more important than eac h city/town's water supply. They need to follow laws and regulations around advertising standards like any other organisation. The advertisement needs to also state truthfully the shift of ownership into 50% owned by Maori and iwi, and not by ratepayers an y longer.",4,308,20605.0,"The television advertisement for the Government's Three Waters campaign was presented |in a cartoon style with the following voiceover: "" Imagine Aotearoa without good water.

Rule 2(b) Truthful Presentation: Advertisements must not mislead or be likely to mislead, deceive or confuse consumers, abuse their trust or exploit their lack of knowledge. Thi s includes by implication, inaccuracy, ambiguity, exaggeration, unrealistic claim, omission, false representation or otherwise. Obvious hyperbole identifiable as such is not considered to be misleading. “The ad implies that by supporting the 3 waters propo sal the public will receive better quality drinking water. This is opinion or conjecture not fact and therefore also unrealistic and so violates rule 2(b). “Rule 1 (i) Protecting the environment …Advertisements must not 21/482 11 depict or encourage environmental da mage or degradation.” The ad clearly encourages the cultivation of trout in the wild which is considered a pest by DoC who try to eradicate it as it is damaging to the indigenous fish. Clear Language I can't find the appropriate code so, bizarely, maybe th ere isn't one but surely an ad should be in a clear language that enables the audience to understand it? This ad mixes two different languages, English and Maori; if the intention is to reach both language speaking audiences, then there should be two ads, one completely in English and the other completely in the Maori language. Please have the ad reworded appropriately. Although, I note, on previous complaints it has been ruled that these ads are not misleading or offensive I, and everyone I know, finds the m so. There is a lot of misinformation being circulated regarding 3 waters and in a previous ruling the chair stated that the councils retained infrastructure ownership; this may be technically true but not in any practical sense as they will not be able t o dispose of those assets nor can they do anything with them unless approved by the four entities within which they only have a 50% vote which means the other 50% has to agree ie councils have no real control in practical terms.

This is the part that most people have alot of trouble understanding. Most people assume that if it reduces your chance of ending up in you from hospital by 95$, it must also reduce your chance of dying by 95%. With respect to death, the study data results were.

The claim that the Pfizer vaccine is experimental and in clinical trials – this is incorrect. The vaccine is not in the experimental stages and had passed the required certifications in several countries. The claim that the Pfizer vaccine is gene therapy is incorrect - Gene therapy, in the classical sense, involves making deliberate changes to a patient’s DNA to treat o r cure them. mRNA vaccines will not enter a cell’s nucleus that houses your DNA genome. The risks to healthy children outweigh the benefits. The source for this claim is the JCVI UK. The JCVI UK did not make this statement. They state “Overall, the committ ee is of the opinion that the benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms” The committee recommends one dose. Masks have been shown to cause hypoxia and mask wearing does not reduce the SARS -Cov2 infection rates – This s tatement neglects to consider the appropriate usage and types of masks as recommended.

I'd like to report two addressed pamphlets delivered today, th e 25th November 2021, to Mount Albert, by Voices for Freedom. There were two double -sided pamphlets (I can only select one attachment in this form): 1. ""Going to Wear that mask all summer?"" followed by selective interpretation of mask wearing in relation t o covid -19. There are no references listed for the claims either, so the recipients are not able to easily substantiate the claims. 2. ""You can't take it back...once they're jabbed"" followed by ""Did they tell you?"". Then we see information such as: Pfizer' s Covid -19 Vaccine is an experimental gene therapy still in clinical trials. This is clearly false and alarmist, combined with a picture of a scared looking child. The vaccine is not experimental gene therapy. It's easily busted by checking facts, and agai n, the source is not cited on the pamphlet. Instead you need to go to their website (and risk being further upset or misinformed). I busted the experimental gene therapy claim in a two second web search which brought up multiple sources to refute this clai m; here is one: https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/blog/why -mrna -vaccines -arent -gene -therapies/ The website that the pamphlets lead you to by the QR code is: voicesforfreedom.co.nz At the very least, they need to be able to accurately reference (such as in an academic paper) their claims, so that recipients can do their own fact checking.

I am concerned that: * These are promoting misinformation and encourage vaccine hesitancy, and discourage mask use to protect oneself and other. This is especially egregious and offensive during a global pandemic when over 5 million people have died worldwide from COVID -19. * This pa mphlet states that their claims are substantiated by the Advertising Standards Authority. There are several complaints in your database which show that claims against them have been upheld in the past, so I feel this statement is misleading. * This pamphle t claims that mask wearing does not help reduce COVID -19 infection rates. There is a lot of evidence to contradict that, for example a recent article in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences found ""The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wea ring reduces transmissibility"". https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118 * This pamphlet claims that adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine are common. While reactions are common (fever etc), severe reactions with permanent side effect are rare. Their statement is misleading, and will encourage vaccine hesitancy. Specifically the claim regarding a ""significant number of serious side effects"". This is unsubstantiated, and they offer no cit ations to back up these claims. * This pamphlet claims that the Pfizer vaccine is an experimental gene therapy. This is incorrect. RNA vaccines are not gene therapy, and do not permanently alter a person's genetics. This claim is misleading, and fearmonger ing, and will encourage vaccine hesitancy, which will ultimately cause people to die from COVID. * This pamphlet contains many statements which are fear mongering in nature, designed to cause vaccine hesitancy with respect to vaccinating children. Vaccinat ing children is important to stop onward transmission of COVID in the community. * This pamphlet states that the ""vaccine does NOT prevent a person from catching or passing on SARS -CoV-2 virus"". While this is technically true, they neglect to state that a vaccinated person is much less likely to contract and pass on COVID -19 to other people, and that the rate of hospitalization and death is greatly reduced in vaccinated people. This statement could be misinterpreted to suggest that vaccination isn't worthwh ile, and that is untrue. As can be clearly seen by the stabilization of case numbers here in NZ as our vaccination rates have risen, vaccination is a key tool in reducing transmission of COVID -19 in a community. We can also see that the number of unvaccina ted people in hospital with COVID -19 is much higher than the relative number of unvaccinated people in the community, clearly showing that the vaccine helps reduce the seriousness of COVID -19.",1,286,20641.0,not to be used again,,20,

They have presented convincingly packaged misinformation designed to mislead consumers about preventing, testing for and treating Covid -19 and attempt to cast doubt on important public health and safety measures. This material undermines the ability of consumers who may rely on it to make an informed decision. A decision cannot be an informed one if you are making it on the basis of untruths. In addition the material incites consu mers to disregard information from trustworthy sources such as health authorities and avoid public 2 health measures such as vaccination, mask wearing and getting tested. Although the information contained in this advertising fails to meet a reasonable per son standard for factual information and does not stand up to any level of scrutiny or fact checking, inexplicably the ASA appears to have endorsed the information as substantiated. The group has highlighted this on their material in order to give it the i llusion of legitimacy. I am the mother of an 1 1 year old with a genetic condition involving heart defects that likely means that he is more vulnerable to this virus. He is not yet eligible to be vaccinated so is relying on friends, family, teachers and ne ighbours to be vaccinated and comply with public health measures to keep the virus away from him. This matter is not just an academic exercise, trusting our medical professionals and our vaccination programme will save lives in these extraordinary times.

22125,22/125,Meridian Energy Limited,"Meridian Energy, Television",24/05/2022,22129,"I saw the Meridian advert this morning. The whole advert wasn't aired but I have seen it several times in it's unedited version. 07:00 is an approximate time. I would appreciate a review of the Meridian advertisement referred to as ”Meridian Energy, Be good to Nature and she’ll be good to you” currently being aired on TV. I understand the figure in green is an allegory meant to represent the forces of nature but I find this advert disturbing, distasteful and alarming. I will refer to this character as “she” as this portrayal is a voluptuous, feminine person and there should be no issues with using feminine pronouns. She walks down the street casting fear, anxiety and apprehension into all those around her. So we are teaching people to rule by fear? 2 Intimidation is approved by Meridian? Are we consolidating the mind-set that “might is right”? She sees a man throwing away a plastic bottle and retaliates by using her power to throw him into the duck pond. We are invited to agree that vigilantism is acceptable. I would imagine that no person or animal was hurt in the making of this scene but it is a flagrant disregard for the well being of people and animals: easily influenced people may think they could do the same with no thought of repercussion. We make bullying acceptable by continuing to allow this advert to run. What happened to the catchphrase “be kind to each other” used daily during COVID? She sees a man using an axe and throws it into a garden. This is a brazen indifference to the safety of others and again, may lead to naïve or thoughtless people to assume such behaviour is acceptable and they can also act with impunity. The scene that most concerns me is where she hipbumps the car. All that smoke can not be good for the environment but here is Meridian wilfully causing pollution to further their own ends and then to use fire on the road? This beggars belief. I find this very disturbing: even if this was done with special effects it certainly doesn’t represent a “clean green” image. And if real fire was used, what of the damage to the environment that all New Zealanders have to live in? Are we morally complicit by taking no action that arson is acceptable? I’m also troubled with having a child talking to a strange person. This flies in the face of everything we try to imbue in our children. We attempt to instill in them the very real risk relating to ‘stranger danger’ but here is Meridian teaching them this is completely acceptable and indeed fun with no thought for the 22/125 7 implications of such actions for the safety of the nation’s children. I accept this is an allegory but this advert encourages young, impressionable children that is OK to interact with extrovert, “larger than life” people that they don’t know and I find this very worrying. Are we, the people of New Zealand, by letting this advert run, complicit in allowing the grooming of our childen? I find this whole advert reprehensible and completely at odds with Meridian’s ostensible attempt to depict themselves as responsible and ethical: if anything; this advert is the antithesis of such principals. This is the embodiment of calculated disregard for the needs of others and our environment camouflaged as “nature”. If an actual person to act in this immoral, amoral and disgraceful manner hopefully their actions would bring the law into action but we are meant to approve of such behaviour. I find this entire advert worrying distasteful and morally wrong, therefore I believe a review is needful.",2,448,20746.0,"The Meridian Energy television advertisement shows a quiet town disrupted by a sudden,storm and lightning flash followed by the arrival of a woman dressed in a flowing green coat,in the character of Mother Nature.

This is likely to mislead, deceive and confuse parents into thinking that their child will be protected for life from Covid -19 if they get them vaccinated. Yet this is incorrect. I do not believe that the Ministry of Health hold evidence to substantiate this claim. The Ministry of Health should not be claiming lifelong immunity to Covid -19 for children through vaccination when there is significant division of informed and scientific opinion in rega rd to the vaccines providing any immunity, let alone life long. The ad breaches 2(e) in several ways. 2(e) states that 'opinion in support of the advertiser's position must be clearly distinguishable from factual information.' The statement in the ad of 'P rotect them for life. Immunise.' is opinion in support of the Ministry of Health's agenda to vaccinate as many children as possible. The statement 'Covid -19 Vaccinations are available for tamariki aged 5 -11' is factual information. By these statements bein g stacked, opinion is not clearly distinguishable from factual information. The ad thus breaches 2(e)of the advertising standards code.

Whatever protection from Covid 19 that the Pfizer injection provid es, rapidly decreases over time. This is fully acknowledged within the government's own Covid vaccination strategy, with the claimed need for all vaccinated people to get 'boosted'. To say ""Protect them for life"" directly implies a lifelong protection, whi ch is simply not the case (unless they mean protected as long as you have another booster every 6 months for the rest of your life...). When I buy a helmet for protection in forestry, the makers/sellers of the helmet could not say that the helmet will ""Pro tect me for life"", as the helmet must be replaced every few years (as they deteriorate). It would be fraudulent for it to be advertised as ""protecting me for life"". Now it may be that the writers of the ad meant it as simply a 'play on words' (get protecte d so you can carry on with life). But the other, literal meaning (lifelong protection), must also be true, or else the text is a fraudulent claim. Secondly, the advertisement is misleading/gives false information, with the claim that to 'immunise' will giv e protection from Covid. Again, based on the current data from the Ministry of Health's own reporting (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in -depth/450874/covid -19-data-visualisations -nz-in-numbers ), of all the people who have DIED with Covid in NZ, WELL OVER HALF HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AND BOOSTED. And from the same source, of all the current hospitalisations with Covid, the VAST MAJORITY are either 'fully vaccinated ' or vaccinated and 'boosted'. It is simply false to claim that the vaccination will ""protect them"", when clearly by the government's own data, vaccinated and boosted people are sick and dying with Covid. Any other product that performed as poorly, in cont rast to what advertisers claimed, would have to be withdrawn. If I put on sunblock that is claimed to ""give me protection"", and I still get badly sunburnt (even when following the manufacturer's use guidelines) then the sunblock would no longer be able to be advertised and sold as sunblock. I realise that it is difficult for the ASA to make a judgement on the government's health strategy and current position on a 'controversial' topic.

It also implies something also statistically very unlilkely: thus creating fear, and using this for a greater uptake of its products. The Headline 'Protect the m for life' is a two fold concern. It implies the covid vaccine offers life -long protection (it offers, at best 3 months) and scientific evidence shows it does not necessarily protect from getting sick from, or passing on, the virus covid. (Both facts from the Ministry of Health website) Yet the headline makes the outrageous claim that this is 'lasting' (even lifelong) protection from covid. Even if the word 'life' in the headline is to be interpreted in a 'lifestyle' or 'health', then this does not account for the fact immunised children can still get sick. Also 'life' seems to at best promise they will not be able to participate in life to its fullest without vaccination, at worst, that they are risking death if they are unvaccinated. ALL possible interpre tations of this headline are false. Especially and categorically for the age -group they are mentioning (aged 5 -11). Ages 5 -11 are in the lowest possible category of severe infection. If this were for a similar commercial health product (example a vitamin), it would absolutely have to backup its claims with lifelong health benefits or specific absolute risk to the individual in order to make these claims. This advert has neither. It is also depicts children enjoying sports and the outdoors, play centres and or schools as if immunisation provides the 'gateway' or ability to attend these events - This is again strictly untrue in every instance. I totally support community health and the wellbeing of children, but this promises benefits from a vaccine that does NOT deliver the promises it makes. Which makes me ask the question, why would you use this type of headline 'Protect them for life'? Protect them for at least six months could be argued. Protect our children against Covid could possibly be argued, but less so on the basis of how little severe covid illness there is in this age group. Therefore, they advertisers are displaying a desire to exaggerate the claims, not for better or more accurate advertising, but for more 'uptake' which is both cynical and misle ading. I also object on the fear or perception of not being able to lead a 'normal' healthy life without covid immunisation.

22195,22/195,Te Whatu Ora /Health New,Zealand,16/07/2022,22215,"MINISTRY OF HEALTH ADVERTISING CAMPAGNE: “PROTECT THEM FOR LIFE” 1. I refer to the recent Ministry of Health advertising, attached to this letter. 2. This advertising from the department responsible for the health of New Zealanders states that Covid -19 products: ""Protect them for life. Immunise. COVID -19 vaccinations are available for tamariki aged 5 -11."" 3. This statement is not only misleading and deceptive, the Ministry of Health knows it is false. 4. The Ministry of Health whose advertising it is, is: 22/195 12 a. aware that the effectiveness of the paediatric vaccine against COVID -19 infection was 12% for 5 to 11 year olds (observed during the Omicron wave (13 December 2021 to 30 January 2022); and b. recommending boosters in immunocompromised children very shortly af ter the roll out of the C -19 Pfizer product in children. 5. This information and recommendations come from COVID -19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group (CV -TAG), which is a group within Medsafe headed by Dr George Town: https://www.health.govt.nz/about -ministry/leadership -ministry/expert - groups/covid -19-vaccine -technical -advisory -group -cv-tag Issue 1: the product is o nly 12% effective 6. Dr George Town is aware of and has relied upon a pre -print study by the New York State Department of Health (dated 25 February 2022) found that effectiveness of the paediatric vaccine against COVID -19 infection was 12% for 5 to 11 year olds (observed during the Omicron wave (13 December 2021 to 30 January 2022)).1 7. For comparison, most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients.2 The nature of childhood vaccines using traditional vaccine technology means children are protected for life with the majority of childhood vaccines. 1 Dorabawila V, Hoefer D, Bauer UE, Bassett MT, Lutterloh E, Rosenberg ES, Effectiveness of the BNT162B2 vaccine among children 5 -11and12 -17 years in New York after the emergency of the Omicron variant, 28 February 2022 (available here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.25.22271454vl) . This article isa preprint. 2 https://www.fda.gov/vaccines -blood -biologics/safety -availability -biologics/vaccine - safety -questions -and-answers 8. Of note, a vaccine efficacy of less than 50% fails FDA guidelines for approval especially when the absolute risk reduction is significantly less than 1%. 9. If the paediatric COVID -19 vaccine is 12% effective with Omicron then this is certainly no protection against COVID -19. Issue 2: Boosters already? 10. On 16 December 2021, the C -19 product for 5 -11 year olds received provisional consent from Medsafe. 11. On 17 January 2022, the roll out of the C -19 products to this age group commenced. 12. In just over 2 months, the CV -Tag is recommending a booster shot (3rd shot) in immunocompromised children. The fact boosters are being recommended in such close succession to the roll out indicates that the effectiveness of the C -19 products in children is waning very quickly, and therefore clearly does not ""protect them for life"". 13. The Ministry of Health is approving booster shots, and is decreasing the time between shots, which clearly indicates the efficac y of the C -19 products are waning. 14. The history of booster shots and shortening of the booster interval is descending chronologically as follows: 22/195 13 • On 7 July 2022 a second booster shot (4th shot) in adults was made available https://www.health.govt.nz/covid -19-novel -coronavirus/covid -19- vaccines/covid -19-vaccine -boosters#additional • On 22 March 2022 first booster shot (3rd shot) in immunocompromised children was recommended by CV -Tag [OIA request has been made - link will be provided forthwith] • On 1 February 2022 booster interval reduced to 3 months for 18+ including immunocompromised and pregnant woman https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/20220201 - cv tag recommendations on booster interval.pdf • On 15 December 2021 CV -TAG recommends use Pfizer mRNA COVID -19 vaccine for children aged 5 11 years: https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/20211215 - cv tag - decision to use vaccine in 5 -11-year-olds.pdf • On 17 November 2021 co nfirmed the first booster shot (3rd shot) in immunocompromised adolescents (12+): https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/20211117 - cv tag - immunocomprom ised update.pdf • On 21 September 2021 first booster shot (3rd shot) in immunocompromised adults was recommended by CV -Tag https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/ pages/20210921 - cv tag - additional dose in the immunocompromised.pdf • On 1 September 2021 the roll out to adolescents commenced: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID -19 vaccination in New Zealand#S eptember 2021 • On 21 February 2021 the roll out of the adult products commenced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID -19 vaccination in New Zealand#September 2021 15.

22275,22/275,Voices for Freedom,"Voices for Freedom, Unaddressed",02/10/2022,22321,"The Voices for Freedom brochure states that: 1. Typical mask wearing does not reduce Covid -19 infection rates - The WHO states that masks are a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives. Wearing well -fitted masks should be used as part of a compr ehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including maintaining physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close -contact settings, ensuring good ventilation of indoor spaces, cleaning hands regularly, and covering sneezes and coughs with a tissue of bent elbow . Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission, or both. 2. Evidence shows masking children is harmful The American Academy of Pediatrics states that children will not be harmed by we aring a mask and it will not impede their development 3. KN95 masks showed 46.3% filtration efficacy (when glued on) and only 3.4% efficacy with a gap - University of Auckland aerosol chemist Dr Joel Rindeluab said that a highquality N95 will block 99% o f particles (and KN95 are not far behind). And I'm not sure who glues on a mask, maybe VFF want to terrify people into thinking they need to glue on their mask 4. Masks are shown to cause hypoxia - For many years, health care providers have worn masks fo r extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions. If hypoxia was an issue then surgeries would not happen at all. Princess Diana's bodyguard spent over 15 hours in surgery to repair his face and not once did the surgeon or other staff faint from lack of oxygen And as an asthmatic myself, I wear a mask where ever possible and I do not find that I have issues breathing.

24065,24/065,Kiwibank Limited,Kiwibank Limited  Digital Marketing,08/04/2024,24068,I believe the Kiwibank video ad posted to their Facebook page (dated 18th March 2024) breaches advertising standards. This also airs during the ad breaks on the TV3 on demand. app It is of a young girl| who I could only assume to be around the age of 10| trying to sell her cupcakes in a stall outside her home however none of her customers have cash on them to pay therefore she provides Apple Pay as a form of payment which then mean people are able to pay through their phone or watch. All of this I have absolutely no problem with. What I do have a problem with is one of the characters in the skit - a man in very small and revealing togs. I would like to draw your attention to the Tip Top ad which aired in 2006 called ’TOGS TOGS| UNDIES’. In a light -hearted and comedic way it illustrated when togs become undies. It states that if you can’t see the water| you’re in underpants.  Clear and simple. I know many people my age would be able to recall this ad and instantly be able to call someone out if they were seen to be wearing their togs in a public setting that wasn’t the beach or swimming pool. In the Kiwibank ad| the man in question is standing in what appears to be a quiet neighbourhood wearing an open Hawaiian style shirt and very small  and tight swimming trunks - no water in sight. His female friend (who is wearing a one piece swimming costume and is covering her lower half with a sarong) starts by saying “We don’t have any pants” the camera then flicks to him and he reinforces it buy saying “Yeah| no pants” while at the same time removing the blow up swimming ring that was covering his lower half revealing his swimming trunks. If a man did this in public to a child| it would be deemed sexual harassment. I believe this breaches advertising standards under PRINCIPLE 1: SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Rule 1 (c) Decency and Offensiveness and under the Children and Young People’s Advertising Code as moral harm. I am not prudish or trying to be a ’Karen’| I’m simply standing up as a 30 year old mother who wants to protect my child’s innocence.,4,2068,,,,,0.0

24093,24/093,DB Breweries Limited,"Whiteclaw, Digital Marketing",31/05/2024,24094,1. This letter is to formally complain under the Alcohol Advertising and |Promotion Code about an  alcohol advertisement featuring the use of dangerous equipment |and watersports which would  be unsafe when combined with alcohol consumption.  |2. The advertisement features kitesurfing and Whiteclaw| a recently launched RTD. The  |advertisement was posted on 28 March 2024| on the Instagram account marcjacobskite| and |is labelled #ad and #gifted for @whiteclawnz.   |3. The advertisement is viewable here| and key screenshots are included below:  |4. The advertisement shows a kite surfer on top of a ute. A can of Whiteclaw is on top of the |roof rack and two boxes of Whiteclaw and an open chilly bin are on the open tailgate of the |vehicle.The kite surfer launches from the roof of the ute before coming back to collect a can |of Whiteclaw  in midflight. He does some tricks before being speeding past the camera |holding a can of  Whiteclaw. After performing more complex aerial tricks he touches down on |the tailgate of the  ute where three boxes of Whiteclaw and the chilly bin are ready. In the |next shot he flies over the  roof of the ute and collects another can of Whiteclaw from the roof |rack. He then packs up his kite  and sits down on the tailgate of the ute and drinks a can of |Whiteclaw.   |5. Guideline 1 Rule 1(e) of the Alcohol Advertising and Promotion Code| (Safety) states |alcohol  advertising and promotion must not link alcohol consumption with hazardous or |unsafe practices  or behaviour that is risky| for example| but not limited to:  a. the use of |potentially dangerous machinery| equipment or when driving;  b. swimming and other water |sports which would be unsafe when combined with Alcohol  consumption.  |6. Guideline 2 continues that sporting and other physical activities may be represented in |Alcohol  Advertising and Promotion| providing there is no implication that alcohol will be |consumed before  or during the activity| or after endurance events or injury.   |7. We submit that this advertisement may be in breach of Rule 1(e) (safety) of the Alcohol  |Advertising and Promotion Code.  |8. We submit that this advertisement links alcohol consumption with risky behaviour| use of  |potentially dangerous equipment| and watersports. Repeated featuring of Whiteclaw RTD  |products being grasped from the motor vehicle by the kite surfer while in flight comes  |unnecessarily close to implying that alcohol may be consumed before or during the activity.  | 24/093 |2 9. We draw the attention of the Complaints Board to the fact it was actual product| not just a |brand  impression| that was featuring before the kitesurfing commenced| and that was on |more than one  occasion in the hands of the kite surfer midflight.  |10. While the Whiteclaw was explicitly consumed on the motor vehicle after the kitesurfing |was complete| we consider the advertisement implicitly associates alcohol consumption with |the kinds  of behaviours considered in Rule 1(e) of the Code.  |11. Please advise when the Complaints Boards Chair has determined whether this complaint |is to go before the Complaints Board| and provide a reference number for tracking.,3,3191,24056.0,The Instagram advertisement for  White Claw seltzers posted by  Marc |Jacob  shows him kitesurfing and performing aerial tricks including picking up a can of White |Claw mid trick.

24101,24/101,Forest & Bird,Forest & Bird Digital Marketing,11/06/2024,24101,"To whom it may concern| I am writing on behalf of the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association  (NZDA) regarding a matter of concern related to statements made by Forest and Bird NZ  concerning their status as ""New Zealand’s leading independent conservation orga nisation.""     It has come to our attention that Forest and Bird NZ has repeatedly made claims regarding  their position as the foremost entity in independent conservation efforts in New Zealand. As  an organization deeply committed to the preservation of our natural envir onment| we believe  it is essential to ensure accuracy and accountability in such assertions. The NZDA respectfully  requests that Forest and Bird NZ provide evidence to substantiate this claim| as it pertains to  their contributions to conservation efforts o n the ground.     Specifically| we seek clarification on the basis for their assertion| considering the following  criteria:     1. Direct Financial Contributions:   We inquire whether Forest and Bird NZ leads in terms of direct monetary contributions to  conservation programs actively engaged in on -the-ground conservation work.     2. Membership Engagement: We seek clarification on whether Forest and Bird NZ boasts the  largest membership base actively involved in conducting conservation activities| such as  trapline laying| predator eradication| and other practical conservation effort s.     3. Volunteer Hours: We request information on the total volunteer hours dedicated to  conservation work by Forest and Bird NZ members| including activities such as predator  control| habitat restoration| and species management.     4. The NZDA emphasizes that conservation efforts| as defined by the Cambridge dictionary|  encompass practical actions aimed at protecting and preserving natural ecosystems and  wildlife from the adverse impacts of human activity. Therefore| activities such as fundraising  and advocacy| while valuable| may not suffice to support claims of leadership in conservation  without substantial evidence of direct on -the-ground contributions. In contrast| the NZDA takes  pride in its extensive membership base of approxima tely 12|000 individuals spread across 48  branches nationwide| actively engaged in conservation activities through recreational hunting|  trapline maintenance| hut upkeep| and collaborative efforts with conservation agencies such  as the Department of Conserv ation and other relevant groups.    24/101  2 Furthermore| our members' dedication to conservation is underscored by the recognition  received from conservation authorities| such as the Department of Conservation's provision  of discounted hut passes exclusively available to groups demonstrating signifi cant  conservation contributions| a privilege not extended to Forest and Bird NZ. As we compile  comprehensive data on our members' volunteer hours| hunting activities| and financial  contributions to conservation initiatives| we anticipate demonstrating that  the NZDA's  collective efforts align closely with the criteria outlined for leadership in independent  conservation endeavors.     Given that recreational hunters routinely spend hours on species management multiple times  per year| we expect that our conservation hours will far surpass those of Forest and Bird's|  before taking into account the dedicated conservation initiatives hosted  by our regional  branches.     In conclusion| the NZDA seeks clarity and transparency regarding Forest and Bird NZ's claims  of leadership in conservation| and that they immediately cease making this claim in support of  their fundraising activities.     We firmly believe that the NZDA not only excels as New Zealand’s foremost independent  hunting organization| but also emerges as a leading force in conservation efforts| as evidenced  by our rigorous adherence to practical conservation activities. We appreci ate your prompt  attention to this matter and look forward to receiving the necessary information to address our  concerns.",5,4000,24058.0,This complaint concerned two advertisements. The first was the Forest & Bird website and  the second was a Forest & Bird Instagram advertisement.

I will never get my name on my birth certificate due to the 1955 Adoption Act. This story is not fictitious. It's happening to over 100|000 of your Kiwi friends and family| and making light of it is horrific.

He begins his search with nothing more than a tartan -wrapped stone which links his arrival as a brown baby into the home of a white family. - It is a fictional story| however it is of adoption and lost whakapapa that is common and personally recognizable as a serious and sensitive topic for thousands of New Zealanders. - This advertisement exploits of this sensitive topic of adoption to convey a message of “connectedness”| The advertiser has attempted a humorous tone| however the insensitivity shown by this advertisement causes harm to both the children and parents separated at birth| and to other individuals without knowledge of their whakapapa (e.g. sperm donation). - Adoption and separation from family of origin| resulting in loss of identity and whakapapa| is a potentially traumatic event with far reaching social and mental health implications for individuals involved. - This large -scale multimedia advertising campaign is unavoidable – in addition to the broadcast and online video content| it is shown in cinemas| and large billboards are used on motorways| shopping centres| airports etc. - To say that the advertiser should have handled the topic of adoption more sensitively overlooks the fact that a large -scale campaign focusing this sensitive topic should never have been considered in the first place. Specific examples of the breach of Principle of Social Responsibility - The advertisement insensitively and offensively minimizes the trauma of adoption| and normalizes harmful adoption practices| particularly in relation vulnerable young people discovering their loss of whakapapa. The revelation by the main character’s adoptive parents that he is not “biologically speaking| the fruit of their loins” is depicted as a casual conversation while sitting in a spa pool. This is an attempt at a humorous depiction of what is highly impactful moment in a child’s life| and the insensitive depiction will be causing harm to individuals who have experienced similar situations. This depiction also normalizes the harmful concept that it is acceptable to erase or withhold biological identity. It also harmfully reinforces the unreasonable expectations held by society that the adopted child should be universally grateful for being adopted| and that the child should accept 23/129 2 without complaint that their whakapapa has been erased at birth. This advertisement also seems to depict the main character (brown) being thankful that he is in fact not biologically related to his embarrassing (white) parents. This is a stereotypical trope commonly portrayed| the result of which is to minimize the actual harm caused to adopted children – “yes you’re adopted but your parents are kind of awful and embarrassing| be grateful you’re not actually related!” This advertisement harmfully normalizes a situation that has seen a child separated from his biological parents at birth without a thorough legal process ensuring the care and protection of the child. The main character is depicted searching for his whakapapa| with nothing other than a “stone” that was “with me when they got me” and a highland cow for support. This story is depicted in a present day timeline| and depicts complete ignorance of his adoptive parents and a seeming lack of any involvement of the Crown in a formal process that lead to him being raised with his “adoptive” parents. This is a fantasy and a harmful depiction which minimizes the rights of a child to knowledge of their whakapapa| and the availability of agencies and support that exist in New Zealand to support young people embarking on their own personal search for identity. The depiction of a birth mother’s reaction to being found by a child separated at birth is insensitive and offensive. The birth mother is depicted being approached for the first time by her biological child. For most adopted individuals| if this moment of connection is eventually made| the first reunion is an extraordinarily private and potentially traumatic moment in an adopted individual’s life. Yet in this advertisement| it is depicted with humour| and grossly lacks sensitivity and appropriateness. The birth mother is depicted seemingly hiding in a hermit - like existence in the Scottish Highlands before being “found” by the child she was separated from at birth. It might be expected that a birth -mother first “being found” by a child in this circumstance may have recalled memories of far greater and likely negative impact. For example| the shock of an unplanned pregnancy; the dilemma of an unwanted pregnancy; the decision not to terminate the pregnancy; the impact of the 9 month pregnancy; the eventual outcome where she is separated from the child| which likely resulted in significant trauma and grief. Instead the advertisement minimises the trauma on birth parents and depicts that birth -mother reacting with a sheepish smile and remembering an enthusiastic sexual encounter and a screaming baby – a flooding recollection of 20 years of grief and loss which would be a far more accurate but less heartwarming for the purposes of this advertisement. There is one tenuous moment linking One NZ as a telecommunication company (the advertiser) with the main character’s search for their whakapapa. It is when a One NZ employee uses a mobile phone app to match a unique tartan pattern with a specific location in Scotland. One NZ are a telecommunication company| not a social agency. Perhaps One NZ should have depicted the main character making formal enquiries with Oranga Tamariki on his One NZ mobile phone| so that he can be privately supported through an official and structured search for his whakapapa. In the interests of all adopted New Zealanders| One NZ should cease this advertising campaign immediately,3,6630,,,,,0.0
24130,24/130,2degrees Mobile,2degrees Mobile  Live Television,22/07/2024,24129,"Advertisement features a man with a blindfolded woman in a life -raft in the middle of the lake. The actions and facial expressions of the woman are such that she conveys a feeling of discomfort and tension as she does not know she is on a lake| she does not know the man she is in the boat with or what is going to happen. Her answers are concerned with her safety e.g. replying that she would call the ’coastguard’ when he asks who she would call and that she ""can’t swim’. She also wears office casual clothes| further adding to the impressions that she is not familiar with the context. The man portrays the demeanour of being unconcerned about her or their position| saying in response to her claim of not being able to swim| that ’neither can I"". She is then told to ’start bailing’ as quite obviously the boat is sinking - still with her mask on. This ad is genuinely disturbing in the current context of attention being drawn to the number of women who meet harm at the hands of men. This is not a long bow to draw - the woman in the boat is clearly not in control| she does not know why she is there and her safety (even though she is in a life jacket) and indeed the entire situation is entirely within the control of the man. Her level of discomfort and the situation she is in is entirely disproportionate to the reason for her being there which is to test if she can ’see’ the difference between the two networks and I suspect that this is meant to be the nature of the alleged ’humour’. However| this is entirely tone -deaf| and would be the case with any gender in the boat under those circumstances but particularly and significantly so since it is a woman. I felt genuine discomfort and distress watching this ad| not only because of the content| but because its very creation and the number of hands and eyes this would have passed through and been approved by| equally reflect the issue that I am disturbed by in the finished product. I don’t think this is humorous but another ’soft’ example that normalises these disproportionate power relationships that in reality lead to the harm of women| in this case under the guise of humour. I am even reluctant to write this for that very reason| but have had a lifetime of this response to my and other women’s very real experience of discomfort and fear with what are often routine interactions with men.

Specifically| I am raising concern around a misleading Instagram advertisement which  Informed Investor has paid to have boosted as sponsored content. This post was posted on  3 July 2024| and it’s entitled “Investment 101: What is compound interest?”.     Having read their post several times over| and having shared it with friends for discussion| I  am convinced that there are serious errors in the facts and financial literacy education that  Informed Investor is presenting to the New Zealand public about compound interest in this 3  July 2024 advertisement.     For example| the post states “You earn $5 in the first year| giving you $1|005. But then you  earn 5% not only on your original $1|000| but also on the interest you earn. After five years|  you have roughly $12|760”. This is incorrect mathematics| and this information is misleading  for members of the New Zealand public with limited financial literacy who might expect that  $1|000 could become $12|760 after five years in a 5% simple interest account through  compounding interest as a result of this advertisement.     The post also cites| on another photographic slide| that 5% of $10|000 is $50. I am filing this  complaint as I am generally concerned that a financial literacy and advice provider with a  paid subscription model in New Zealand is posting a self -sponsored advertisement publicly|  with what appears to demonstrate zero effort made around proofreading or ensuring basic  facts are correct before presenting that paid advertisement as financial advice to the New  Zealand public.

24185,24/185,ACT Party,ACT Party  Stuff Website,23/10/2024,24179,I am concerned with the wording of this advert from the Act party. “Restore”  implies the proposed bill is merely reinstating a previous state.

24185,24/185,ACT Party,ACT Party  Stuff Website,23/10/2024,24180,The word ‘restore’ equal rights is inflammatory and unsubstantiated. ’restore’   implies that people have less than equal rights. But they do not clarify who allegedly has  more rights and who has less. The ad is designed to inflame and divide and is deeply  offensive. I am a typical ACT voter demographic but I am shocked that they are allowed to  campaign in this way.,2,371,,,,,0.0

24189,24/189,Air New Zealand Ltd,Air New Zealand Ltd  Addressed Mail,07/10/2024,24184,Air NZ advertises their Airpoints by saying 鈥? Airpoints Dollar 鈩?is the equivalent |to 1 New Zealand Dollar鈥? However| when you go to spend them| you can only spend them |in the Air NZ store and if you try to use them to purchase flights with Air NZ| you can鈥檛 use |them towards the tax or airport fees for the flight| so you can actually only use them for 60 -|70% of the value of the flight. Therefore an Airpoints dollar is not equivalent to a New |Zealand dollar as with a New Zealand dollar you can pay for the full value of a flight but with |an Airpoint dollar you can only pay for 60 -70% of a flight. Air NZ should not be able to make |this claim as it's misleading and incorrect. Also Airpoints can only be spent at the Airpoints |store| so they鈥檙e not as flexible as a New Zealand dollar| so again the claim that they鈥檙e |equivalent is misleading,1,858,,,,,0.0

It also implies that a woman can get financial success very |easily by using Afterpay| which in most cases could be quite unrealistic and breaks Rule 2 |(b) Truthful presentation| where the product must not mislead| deceive or confuse |consumers| or abuse their trust or exploit their lack of knowledge| and cannot exaggerate or |make an unrealistic claim or false representation.

This advertisement also deceives and misleads people with those |assumptions implied| and that it is easy to get that degree of financial success quickly which |is probably quite unrealistic and degrading for women.
